<p>Hammett biographer Richard Layman will begin the evening with a brief overview of Hammett&#8217;s remarkable life and literary career, tracing his path from high-school dropout to world-renowned author. Layman&#8217;s remarks will set the stage for Julie Rivett&#8217;s discussion of her grandfatherâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s complicated literary afterlife.</p>
<p>Julie Rivett and special guest Richard Layman will close the evening with discussion and a question-and-answer session. Layman has written or edited eight books on Dashiell Hammett, including <a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0822933942" target="_blank"><em>Dashiell Hammett: a Descriptive Bibliography</em>,</a> <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0897230523" target="_blank">Shadow Man: The Life of Dashiell Hammett</a></em>, and <a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0972589864" target="_blank"><em>Discovering The Maltese Falcon and Sam Spade</em>,</a> nominated for an Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America.</p>
<p>Together Layman and Rivett have edited four books by or about Dashiell Hammett. <a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1582432104"><em>Selected Letters of Dashiell Hammett: 1921-1960</em></a> and <a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0786708921"><em>Dashiell Hammett: A Daughter Remembers</em></a> by Jo Hammett were published in 2001. <a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0802120504"><em>The Return of the Thin Man</em></a>, with Hammettâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s screen treatments for two of the beloved <em>Thin Man</em> film series sequels, was released in 2012. <em>The Hunter and Other Stories</em>, featuring unpublished and previously uncollected Hammett fiction, will make its debut in November 2013.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES</strong></p>
<p><span class="caps">LAVA</span>â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Literary Salon is a place for lovers of great Los Angeles writers to come together in historic spaces for good company, fine food, and fascinating discussions by experts in the field. Join us in the historic Los Angeles Athletic Club, where Raymond Chandler, then a young oil executive, played bridge and eavesdropped on the powerful men who would shape the city and his detective fiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s impossible to understand Los Angeles literature out of context of the place. In the 1920s and 1930s, L.A. was bursting at the seams, as one of the biggest boom towns the world had ever seen. And as the city grew, it attracted a varied and fascinating population: East coast intellectuals, filmmakers, European refugees, hustlers and visionaries of all stripes.</p>
<p>In this young city without an established cultural scene, the intelligentsia congregated in book shops, each with its own personality shaped by the book seller who curated the selection and the space. In the Salon series, we celebrate the forgotten history of L.A. book culture, from Hollywood Boulevard to downtownâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Booksellerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Row, in an original presentation by Howard Prouty. Each book shopâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s story illuminates the literary life of the city, and the emotional growth of the writers who called Los Angeles home.&nbsp;(Please note, Howard Prouty will not be presenting at the April 2013 Salon)</p>

<p>OTHER TULLY EVENTS: <em>Laughter in Hell</em> screening at the <a href="https://www.americancinematheque.com/" target="_blank">American Cinematheque</a> (October 10); <a href="https://blogs.library.ucla.edu/special/2012/09/06/save-the-date-jim-tully-subject-of-bonnie-cashin-lecture-on-october-11/" target="_blank">Bonnie Cashin Lecture</a> at UCLA Special Collections (October 11); Jim Tully&#8217;s Hollywood <a href="/tullywalk" target="_blank">walking tour</a> (October 14).</p>
<p>ABOUT JIM TULLY:&nbsp;The son of an Irish ditch-digger, Ohio-born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Tully">Jim Tully</a> (1886-1947) hit the road in 1901, spending most of his teenage years in the company of hoboes. While chasing his dream of becoming a writer, Tully rode the rails and worked as a tree surgeon, boxer, and newspaper reporter. All the while, he was crafting his memories into a dark and original chronicle of the American underclass. When he began to set his experiences onto paper in a style that was Hard Boiled before the genre existed, he became a literary sensation.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://archive.org/download/JimTullyOneSheet/TullyFlyer.pdf" target="new">Jim Tully â€˜One Sheetâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></p>
<p>At Octoberâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Salon, Jim Tullyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s biographers Mark Dawidziak and Paul Bauer will seek to answer the fundamental question: â€œWhy isnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t Jim Tully still a household name?â€ Tully exploded onto the scene with a stream of critically acclaimed novels, among them <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1606350005" target="_blank">Beggars of Life</a></em> (1924), <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1606350013" target="_blank">Circus Parade</a></em> (1927), <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1606350234" target="_blank">Shanty Irish</a></em> (1928), <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/B0018EYKKI" target="_blank">Shadows of Men</a></em> (1930) and <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/B00085NF8G" target="_blank">Blood on the Moon</a></em> (1931). Yet the books were out-of-print for decades, their author forgotten.</p>
<p>To answer this question, Mark Dawidziak and Paul Bauer must look to the Hollywood of 1912, to the sleepy little suburb that Tully found and watched grow up around him, as he built his incongruous twin careers as motion picture&nbsp;publicist and independent writer. From his piercing insights into and deep ambivalence toward his longtime employer, Charlie Chaplin, to anecdotes of great friendships with W. C. Fields, Jack Dempsey, Damon Runyon, Lon Chaney, Frank Capra, and Erich von Stroheim, Tully exhibited a lust for life which was only surpassed by his devotion to his craft.  By 1930 Tully was a major American author, and had launched a parallel career as a successful journalist. Both his novels and journalistic exposÃ©s shook the country and his peer group in Hollywood.</p>
<p>But Tullyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s novel <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0983031436" target="_blank">Ladies In The Parlor</a></em> (1935), was declared obscene and most copies destroyed, and Chaplin successfully prevented Tullyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s publisher from releasing a biography of the actor. By the mid-1940s, crippling physical ailments and family heartbreak left the writer on the ropes.  With his death in 1947, his name quietly slipped from the front ranks of American Letters and into obscurity.</p>
<p>Since 2009, Kent State University Press has been rectifying this long neglect with a series of Tully reprints. And in 2011, it published Mark Dawidziak and Paul Bauerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s definitive biography,&nbsp;<em><a  href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1606350765" target="_blank">Jim Tully: American Writer, Irish Rover, Hollywood Brawler</a><span style="font-style: normal;">,</span></em>&nbsp;drawing on new information found in the Tully papers at UCLA Special Collections.</p>
<p>The time is ripe for a revival of interest in this fascinating American character, and we invite you to play a part in it at the October Salon.</p>
<p>Paul Bauer cowrote Frazier Robinsonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s autobiography, Catching Dreams: My Life in the Negro Baseball Leagues.  And, with Mark Dawidziak, he is the coauthor of&nbsp;<a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1606350765" target="_blank"><em>Jim Tully: American Writer, Irish Rover, Hollywood Brawler</em></a>.  He is a used and rare <a href="ArchersBooks.com">bookseller</a> and lives in Kent, Ohio.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dawidziak">Mark Dawidziak</a> has been the television critic at the Cleveland <em>Plain Dealer </em>since 1999. A theater, film and television reviewer for more than thirty years, his many nonfiction books include <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0913239038" target="_blank">The Barter Theatre Story: Love Made Visible</a></em>, <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0892969849" target="_blank">The Columbo Phile: A Casebook</a></em>, Mark My Words: Mark Twain on Writing,<em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0938817442" target="_blank"> The Night Stalker Companion</a></em>, <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1405123796" target="_blank">Horton Footeâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s The Shape of the River: The Lost Teleplay About Mark Twain</a></em>, <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0826417949" target="_blank">The Bedside, Bathtub &amp; Armchair Companion to Dracula</a></em> and, most recently, with Paul J.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, July 23, you are invited to join writers Adrienne Crew and David Kipen for a lively, informative and sometimes heartbreaking inquiry into the experiences of Dorothy Parker and F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood, as they searched for that elusive thing: a means by which a gifted writer could work in the remunerative field of motion pictures while not completely squandering their talent or losing their mind.  The focus of Ms. Crewâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s talk will be the nexus of writers, directors, actors and professional wits who made the residential hotel The Garden of Allah their Hollywood home, with particular focus on Dorothy Parker and her conflicted relationship with this city. Mr. Kipenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s talk will explore the last few years of F. Scott Fitzgeraldâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s life, particularly the Hollywood-themed Pat Hobby stories which he was working on at the time of his death.  Martin Turnbull will discuss and read from The Garden on Sunset, the first novel in his 9-book series â€œThe Garden of Allah Novels,â€ a fictional celebration of the culture of this legendary establishment. The series follows three naive hopefuls as they leap and lurch, win and lose their way though Hollywoodâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s golden years, with the Garden of Allah as the backdrop to their triumphs and failures.</p>
<p>Also appearing at the Salon is Howard Prouty (Acquisitions Archivist at The Academy Foundation/Margaret Herrick Library and proprietor of ReadInk) presenting on a famous Los Angeles book seller, the third in his ongoing Salon series. This time, this takes the form of a conversation between Howard Prouty and Michael Dawson, focusing on the history of Dawson&#8217;s Bookshop, an important part of L.A.&#8217;s cultural landscape since its founding by Michael&#8217;s grandfather Ernest Dawson in 1905. And before and after the formal dinner and Salon presentations, guests will mingle with Hollywood historian Philip Mershon (proprietor of The Felix in Hollywood Tour Company) and actress Kasey Wilson, appearing in the character of Miss Dorothy Parker.  The day before the Salon, you are invited to register for a free walking tour of Fitzgeraldâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Hollywood, hosted by Ms. Crew. /fitzgeraldwalk2</p>
<h3>The Back Story</h3>
<p>For much of the mid-20th Century, to rub shoulders with Americaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s greatest novelists and screenwriters, one needed merely to go to the corner of Cherokee Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. Here, within the tight triangle of the Writerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Guild offices, Musso &amp; Frank Grill and the Stanley Rose Bookshop, flowed the commercial and social sap that nourished the tree of American letters. The famous minds who congregated still inspire awe: William Faulkner, Scott Fitzgerald, John Fante, Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, James M.

A door was punched through the west wall of the dining room, and a haughty door man installed.

<p>The party raged on, six nights a week, for twenty glorious years.</p>
<p>In 1955, Musso &amp; Frank expanded to the east, and the contents of the â€œBack Roomâ€â€”the long bar, chairs, light fixtures, coat racksâ€”were moved wholesale into the â€œNew Room.â€ The â€œNew Roomâ€ was no longer the exclusive retreat of literary Los Angeles, but the writers kept coming.

<p>In honor of this ongoing writerly tradition, LAVA (The Los Angeles Visionaries Association) is delighted to announce the January 2012 launch of The LAVA Salon at Musso &amp; Frank, a quarterly literary salon and prix fixe dinner celebrating the great writers and personalities who have frequented the establishment.</p>
<p>The LAVA Salon at Musso &amp; Frank is the brainchild of Kim Cooper &amp; Richard Schave, proprietors of literary tour company Esotouricâ€”Raymond Chandlerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Los Angeles, James M.

With this new Salon series, LAVA expands its congenial, intelligent and unpredictable cultural programming into Hollywood with a quarterly literary Salon event held in Musso &amp; Frank on a night when the restaurant is closed to the general public. Seating is extremely limited, and this intimate gathering is sure to sell out quickly.</p>
<p>LAVA co-founder Richard Schave, the Salon host and co-curator, says â€œI would argue that along the bar in the old Cocktail Room, somewhere between the drinking, bragging, fighting and general hell-raising, the better half of the Hard-Boiled School of American Letters was hashed out and put down on paper. The purpose of the Salon is two fold. First, to set the record straight on some basic milestones: the rise and fall of the original Cocktail Room and its reincarnation as the â€œNew Roomâ€ and the symbiotic relationship Musso &amp; Frank shared with the legendary bookshop next door, Stanley Roseâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s.

Musso &amp; Frank is just bricks and mortar, but incredible ideas and connections were forged here, and we believe that spark is waiting to be reignited and make its impression felt in Los Angeles again.â€</p>
<p>Each Mussoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Salon evening will focus on different aspects of Hollywoodâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s literary lore, feature fascinating speakers and special guest historians, and be hosted by LAVA co-founder Richard Schave.</p>

We are extremely excited to work with LAVA to bring you living history in a setting where history continues to happen, even 93 years later. So please enjoy an authentic dinning experience you would have found in the early decades of last century, and bring yourselves back to the time era of the literary giants, and truly get a journey through the history of Hollywood, in the restaurant that Hollywood grew up around, The Musso &amp; Frank Grill.â€</p>
<p>Future Salons will focus on the life and works of Charles Bukowski, Jim Tully, Nathanael West and other fascinating characters whoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve contributed to nearly a century of literary culture at Musso &amp; Frank.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Down These Mean Streets A Man Must Go. . .</h3>
<p>On Monday, April 30, you are invited to join John Buntin, author ofÂ <a style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 12px;" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307352072/ref=nosim/bubblegumbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>L.A. Noir: The Struggle for the Soul of Americaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Most Seductive City</em></a>, for a fresh look at the Los Angeles underworld of the 1920s and â€˜30s. This is the culture which informs noir master Raymond Chandlerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s short stories and early novels. The corrupt civic machine (â€œThe Combinationâ€) fueled the biggest boom town this country has ever seen, and inspired the real life struggles between Good Guys and Bad Guys which in turn influenced much of the fiction and film of the mid 20th Century. At the Salon weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll examine the crusading cop who was the real-life inspiration for Philip Marlowe, then shine our light onto other crusaders, prosecutors and policy makers, who through the decades shift from teetotalers to civil libertarians, but always retain those constants of every Chandler hero: a chance at redemption.</p>
<p>Also appearing at the Salon is Howard Prouty (Acquisitions Archivist at The Academy Foundation/Margaret Herrick Library and proprietor ofÂ <a href="https://www.readinkbooks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReadInk</a>) with a talk on Jake Zeitlin, another in his ongoing Salon series on important booksellers in Los Angeles. And before and after the formal dinner and Salon presentations, guests will mingle with Hollywood historian Philip Mershon (proprietor ofÂ <a href="https://www.felixinhollywoodtours.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Felix in Hollywood Tour Company</a>) and actressÂ <a style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 12px;" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1140069/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasey Wilson</a>, appearing in the character of the helpful female book clerk from <em>The Big Sleep</em>.</p>

Today, Musso &amp; Frankâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s clientele still includes celebrated novelists, screenwriters, poets and songwriters, all of whom cherish the old world hospitality, traditional Continental cuisine and opportunity to soak up the same rarified air that nourished the greats.</p>

<h3>LAVA Literary Salon at Musso &#038; Frank</h3>
<p>In honor of this ongoing writerly tradition, LAVA (The Los Angeles Visionaries Association) is delighted to announce the January 2012 launch of The LAVA Salon at Musso &amp; Frank, a quarterly literary salon and prix fixe dinner celebrating the great writers and personalities who have frequented the establishment. The LAVA Salon at Musso &amp; Frank is the brainchild of Kim Cooper &amp; Richard Schave, proprietors of literary tour company <a href="https://www.esotouric.com/" target="_blank">Esotouric</a>â€”Raymond Chandlerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Los Angeles, James M. Cainâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Southern California Nightmare, Charles Bukowskiâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Haunts of a Dirty Old Man, John Fanteâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Dreams from Bunker Hillâ€”who for the past twenty months have been hosting a free cultural Salon on the last Sunday of the month at Cliftonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Cafeteria (recently moved to the Los Angeles Athletic Club). Now, LAVA expands its congenial, intelligent and unpredictable cultural programming into Hollywood with a quarterly literary Salon event held in Musso &amp; Frank on a night when the restaurant is closed to the general public. Seating is extremely limited, and this intimate gathering is sure to sell out quickly.</p>
<p>LAVA co-founder Richard Schave, the Salon host and co-curator, says â€œI would argue that along the bar in the old Cocktail Room, somewhere between the drinking, bragging, fighting and general hell-raising, the better half of the Hard-Boiled School of American Letters was hashed out and put down on paper. The purpose of the Salon is two fold. First,  to set the record straight on some basic milestones: the rise and fall of the original Cocktail Room and its reincarnation as the â€œNew Roomâ€ and the symbiotic relationship Musso &amp; Frank shared with the legendary bookshop next door, Stanley Roseâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s. Secondly, a more ephemeral aim: in these hallowed rooms, that still bear the nicotine stains from Raymond Chandlerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s pipe and Charles Bukowskiâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s cigarettes, we want to seek out and amplify the spark which all those great souls have left behind. Musso &amp; Frank is just bricks and mortar, but incredible ideas and connections were forged here, and we believe that spark is waiting to be reignited and make its impression felt in Los Angeles again.â€</p>
<p>Each Mussoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Salon evening will focus on different aspects of Hollywoodâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s literary lore, feature fascinating speakers and special guest historians, and be hosted by LAVA co-founder Richard Schave.</p>

And before and after the formal dinner and Salon presentations, guests will mingle with Hollywood historian Philip Mershon (proprietor of <a href="https://www.felixinhollywoodtours.com/" target="_blank">The Felix in Hollywood Tour Company</a>) and actress <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1140069/" target="_blank">Kasey Wilson</a>, appearing in the character of irresistible, murderous Phyllis Dietrichson (â€œDouble Indemnityâ€), the only villainess jointly created by James M. Cain (novel) and Raymond Chandler (screenplay).</p>
<p>Mark Echeverria, 4th generation General Manager/Proprietor of The Musso &amp; Frank Grill, says â€œFor 93 years The Musso &amp; Frank Grill has been a keystone in Hollywoodâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s ever-evolving history. Some of the worldâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s greatest people have walked through our doors, sat at a booth or a bar stool, and dreamt the unimaginable. That is what makes Hollywood so unique: unimaginable things come true. Musso &amp; Frank Grill has always been that inspiration in peopleâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s lives to make the impossible, possible, and it is now time to tell the true story of the people who put Hollywood on the map, and the restaurant they did it inâ€”The Musso &amp; Frank Grill. We are extremely excited to work with LAVA to bring you living history in a setting where history continues to happen, even 93 years later. So please enjoy an authentic dinning experience you would have found in the early decades of last century, and bring yourselves back to the time era of the literary giants, and truly get a journey through the history of Hollywood, in the restaurant that Hollywood grew up around, The Musso &amp; Frank Grill.â€</p>
<p>Dan Fante, speaker at the inaugural quarterly LAVA Salon at Musso &amp; Frank, says, â€œFor me Musso &amp; Frank Grill is the last authentic remnant of Old Hollywood. To walk into the place is stepping into a time machine. The passengers riding with you are guys like Raymond Chandler, Nathanael West, John Fante, William Faulkner, and Charles Bukowski. Not bad company to tip a glass with.â€</p>
<p>Future Salons will focus on the life and works of Raymond Chandler, Charles Bukowski, Nathanael West and other fascinating characters whoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve contributed to nearly a century of literary culture at Musso &amp; Frank.</p>
