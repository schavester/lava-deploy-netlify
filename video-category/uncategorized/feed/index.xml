<p>OTHER TULLY EVENTS: <em>Laughter in Hell</em> screening at the <a href="https://www.americancinematheque.com/" target="_blank">American Cinematheque</a> (October 10); <a href="https://blogs.library.ucla.edu/special/2012/09/06/save-the-date-jim-tully-subject-of-bonnie-cashin-lecture-on-october-11/" target="_blank">Bonnie Cashin Lecture</a> at UCLA Special Collections (October 11); Jim Tully&#8217;s Hollywood <a href="/tullywalk" target="_blank">walking tour</a> (October 14).</p>
<p>ABOUT JIM TULLY:&nbsp;The son of an Irish ditch-digger, Ohio-born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Tully">Jim Tully</a> (1886-1947) hit the road in 1901, spending most of his teenage years in the company of hoboes. While chasing his dream of becoming a writer, Tully rode the rails and worked as a tree surgeon, boxer, and newspaper reporter. All the while, he was crafting his memories into a dark and original chronicle of the American underclass. When he began to set his experiences onto paper in a style that was Hard Boiled before the genre existed, he became a literary sensation.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://archive.org/download/JimTullyOneSheet/TullyFlyer.pdf" target="new">Jim Tully â€˜One Sheetâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a></p>
<p>At Octoberâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Salon, Jim Tullyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s biographers Mark Dawidziak and Paul Bauer will seek to answer the fundamental question: â€œWhy isnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t Jim Tully still a household name?â€ Tully exploded onto the scene with a stream of critically acclaimed novels, among them <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1606350005" target="_blank">Beggars of Life</a></em> (1924), <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1606350013" target="_blank">Circus Parade</a></em> (1927), <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1606350234" target="_blank">Shanty Irish</a></em> (1928), <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/B0018EYKKI" target="_blank">Shadows of Men</a></em> (1930) and <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/B00085NF8G" target="_blank">Blood on the Moon</a></em> (1931). Yet the books were out-of-print for decades, their author forgotten.</p>
<p>To answer this question, Mark Dawidziak and Paul Bauer must look to the Hollywood of 1912, to the sleepy little suburb that Tully found and watched grow up around him, as he built his incongruous twin careers as motion picture&nbsp;publicist and independent writer. From his piercing insights into and deep ambivalence toward his longtime employer, Charlie Chaplin, to anecdotes of great friendships with W. C. Fields, Jack Dempsey, Damon Runyon, Lon Chaney, Frank Capra, and Erich von Stroheim, Tully exhibited a lust for life which was only surpassed by his devotion to his craft.  By 1930 Tully was a major American author, and had launched a parallel career as a successful journalist. Both his novels and journalistic exposÃ©s shook the country and his peer group in Hollywood.</p>
<p>But Tullyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s novel <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0983031436" target="_blank">Ladies In The Parlor</a></em> (1935), was declared obscene and most copies destroyed, and Chaplin successfully prevented Tullyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s publisher from releasing a biography of the actor. By the mid-1940s, crippling physical ailments and family heartbreak left the writer on the ropes.  With his death in 1947, his name quietly slipped from the front ranks of American Letters and into obscurity.</p>
<p>Since 2009, Kent State University Press has been rectifying this long neglect with a series of Tully reprints. And in 2011, it published Mark Dawidziak and Paul Bauerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s definitive biography,&nbsp;<em><a  href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1606350765" target="_blank">Jim Tully: American Writer, Irish Rover, Hollywood Brawler</a><span style="font-style: normal;">,</span></em>&nbsp;drawing on new information found in the Tully papers at UCLA Special Collections.</p>
<p>The time is ripe for a revival of interest in this fascinating American character, and we invite you to play a part in it at the October Salon.</p>
<p>Paul Bauer cowrote Frazier Robinsonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s autobiography, Catching Dreams: My Life in the Negro Baseball Leagues.  And, with Mark Dawidziak, he is the coauthor of&nbsp;<a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1606350765" target="_blank"><em>Jim Tully: American Writer, Irish Rover, Hollywood Brawler</em></a>.  He is a used and rare <a href="ArchersBooks.com">bookseller</a> and lives in Kent, Ohio.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dawidziak">Mark Dawidziak</a> has been the television critic at the Cleveland <em>Plain Dealer </em>since 1999. A theater, film and television reviewer for more than thirty years, his many nonfiction books include <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0913239038" target="_blank">The Barter Theatre Story: Love Made Visible</a></em>, <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0892969849" target="_blank">The Columbo Phile: A Casebook</a></em>, Mark My Words: Mark Twain on Writing,<em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0938817442" target="_blank"> The Night Stalker Companion</a></em>, <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1405123796" target="_blank">Horton Footeâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s The Shape of the River: The Lost Teleplay About Mark Twain</a></em>, <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0826417949" target="_blank">The Bedside, Bathtub &amp; Armchair Companion to Dracula</a></em> and, most recently, with Paul J. Bauer, <a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1606350765" target="_blank"><em>Jim Tully: American Writer, Irish Rover, Hollywood Brawler</em></a>.</p>
<p>Also appearing at the Salon is Howard Prouty (Acquisitions Archivist at The Academy Foundation/Margaret Herrick Library and proprietor of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.readinkbooks.com/" target="_blank">ReadInk</a>) presenting on a famous Los Angeles book seller, the latest in his ongoing Salon series. This time, this takes the form of a conversation between Howard Prouty and Aaron Epstein, son of Louis Epstein, founder of Pickwick Books.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, July 23, you are invited to join writers Adrienne Crew and David Kipen for a lively, informative and sometimes heartbreaking inquiry into the experiences of Dorothy Parker and F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood, as they searched for that elusive thing: a means by which a gifted writer could work in the remunerative field of motion pictures while not completely squandering their talent or losing their mind.  The focus of Ms. Crewâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s talk will be the nexus of writers, directors, actors and professional wits who made the residential hotel The Garden of Allah their Hollywood home, with particular focus on Dorothy Parker and her conflicted relationship with this city. Mr. Kipenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s talk will explore the last few years of F. Scott Fitzgeraldâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s life, particularly the Hollywood-themed Pat Hobby stories which he was working on at the time of his death.  Martin Turnbull will discuss and read from The Garden on Sunset, the first novel in his 9-book series â€œThe Garden of Allah Novels,â€ a fictional celebration of the culture of this legendary establishment. The series follows three naive hopefuls as they leap and lurch, win and lose their way though Hollywoodâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s golden years, with the Garden of Allah as the backdrop to their triumphs and failures.</p>
<p>Also appearing at the Salon is Howard Prouty (Acquisitions Archivist at The Academy Foundation/Margaret Herrick Library and proprietor of ReadInk) presenting on a famous Los Angeles book seller, the third in his ongoing Salon series. This time, this takes the form of a conversation between Howard Prouty and Michael Dawson, focusing on the history of Dawson&#8217;s Bookshop, an important part of L.A.&#8217;s cultural landscape since its founding by Michael&#8217;s grandfather Ernest Dawson in 1905. And before and after the formal dinner and Salon presentations, guests will mingle with Hollywood historian Philip Mershon (proprietor of The Felix in Hollywood Tour Company) and actress Kasey Wilson, appearing in the character of Miss Dorothy Parker.  The day before the Salon, you are invited to register for a free walking tour of Fitzgeraldâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Hollywood, hosted by Ms. Crew. /fitzgeraldwalk2</p>
<h3>The Back Story</h3>
<p>For much of the mid-20th Century, to rub shoulders with Americaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s greatest novelists and screenwriters, one needed merely to go to the corner of Cherokee Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. Here, within the tight triangle of the Writerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Guild offices, Musso &amp; Frank Grill and the Stanley Rose Bookshop, flowed the commercial and social sap that nourished the tree of American letters. The famous minds who congregated still inspire awe: William Faulkner, Scott Fitzgerald, John Fante, Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, William Saroyan, John Oâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Hara, Dorothy Parker, Nathanael West and many more.</p>
<p>And at the center of it all was the famed â€œBack Roomâ€ of Musso &amp; Frank, the oldest restaurant in Hollywood. Beginning in 1936, in response to the restaurantâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s growing popularity, Mussoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s expanded its operations into a small room tucked behind the Vogue Theater. A door was punched through the west wall of the dining room, and a haughty door man installed. His instructions were simple: the back room was to be the exclusive domain of Hollywoodâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s literary lions, their friends and romantic partners. It was called, informally, The Cocktail Room or The Round Table or the Algonquin West.</p>
<p>The party raged on, six nights a week, for twenty glorious years.</p>
<p>In 1955, Musso &amp; Frank expanded to the east, and the contents of the â€œBack Roomâ€â€”the long bar, chairs, light fixtures, coat racksâ€”were moved wholesale into the â€œNew Room.â€ The â€œNew Roomâ€ was no longer the exclusive retreat of literary Los Angeles, but the writers kept coming. Today, Musso &amp; Frankâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s clientele still includes celebrated novelists, screenwriters, poets and songwriters, all of whom cherish the old world hospitality, traditional Continental cuisine and opportunity to soak up the same rarified air that nourished the greats.</p>
<p>In honor of this ongoing writerly tradition, LAVA (The Los Angeles Visionaries Association) is delighted to announce the January 2012 launch of The LAVA Salon at Musso &amp; Frank, a quarterly literary salon and prix fixe dinner celebrating the great writers and personalities who have frequented the establishment.</p>
<p>The LAVA Salon at Musso &amp; Frank is the brainchild of Kim Cooper &amp; Richard Schave, proprietors of literary tour company Esotouricâ€”Raymond Chandlerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Los Angeles, James M. Cainâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Southern California Nightmare, Charles Bukowskiâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Haunts of a Dirty Old Man, John Fanteâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Dreams from Bunker Hillâ€”who for the past twenty months have been hosting a free cultural Salon on the last Sunday of the month at Cliftonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Cafeteria (recently moved to the Los Angeles Athletic Club). With this new Salon series, LAVA expands its congenial, intelligent and unpredictable cultural programming into Hollywood with a quarterly literary Salon event held in Musso &amp; Frank on a night when the restaurant is closed to the general public. Seating is extremely limited, and this intimate gathering is sure to sell out quickly.</p>
<p>LAVA co-founder Richard Schave, the Salon host and co-curator, says â€œI would argue that along the bar in the old Cocktail Room, somewhere between the drinking, bragging, fighting and general hell-raising, the better half of the Hard-Boiled School of American Letters was hashed out and put down on paper. The purpose of the Salon is two fold. First, to set the record straight on some basic milestones: the rise and fall of the original Cocktail Room and its reincarnation as the â€œNew Roomâ€ and the symbiotic relationship Musso &amp; Frank shared with the legendary bookshop next door, Stanley Roseâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s. Secondly, a more ephemeral aim: in these hallowed rooms, that still bear the nicotine stains from Raymond Chandlerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s pipe and Charles Bukowskiâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s cigarettes, we want to seek out and amplify the spark which all those great souls have left behind. Musso &amp; Frank is just bricks and mortar, but incredible ideas and connections were forged here, and we believe that spark is waiting to be reignited and make its impression felt in Los Angeles again.â€</p>
<p>Each Mussoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Salon evening will focus on different aspects of Hollywoodâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s literary lore, feature fascinating speakers and special guest historians, and be hosted by LAVA co-founder Richard Schave.</p>
<p>Mark Echeverria, 4th generation General Manager/Proprietor of The Musso &amp; Frank Grill, says â€œFor 93 years The Musso &amp; Frank Grill has been a keystone in Hollywoodâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s ever-evolving history. Some of the worldâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s greatest people have walked through our doors, sat at a booth or a bar stool, and dreamt the unimaginable. That is what makes Hollywood so unique: unimaginable things come true. Musso &amp; Frank Grill has always been that inspiration in peopleâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s lives to make the impossible, possible, and it is now time to tell the true story of the people who put Hollywood on the map, and the restaurant they did it inâ€”The Musso &amp; Frank Grill. We are extremely excited to work with LAVA to bring you living history in a setting where history continues to happen, even 93 years later. So please enjoy an authentic dinning experience you would have found in the early decades of last century, and bring yourselves back to the time era of the literary giants, and truly get a journey through the history of Hollywood, in the restaurant that Hollywood grew up around, The Musso &amp; Frank Grill.â€</p>
<p>Future Salons will focus on the life and works of Charles Bukowski, Jim Tully, Nathanael West and other fascinating characters whoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve contributed to nearly a century of literary culture at Musso &amp; Frank.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Down These Mean Streets A Man Must Go. . .</h3>
<p>On Monday, April 30, you are invited to join John Buntin, author ofÂ <a style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 12px;" href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307352072/ref=nosim/bubblegumbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>L.A. Noir: The Struggle for the Soul of Americaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Most Seductive City</em></a>, for a fresh look at the Los Angeles underworld of the 1920s and â€˜30s. This is the culture which informs noir master Raymond Chandlerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s short stories and early novels. The corrupt civic machine (â€œThe Combinationâ€) fueled the biggest boom town this country has ever seen, and inspired the real life struggles between Good Guys and Bad Guys which in turn influenced much of the fiction and film of the mid 20th Century. At the Salon weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll examine the crusading cop who was the real-life inspiration for Philip Marlowe, then shine our light onto other crusaders, prosecutors and policy makers, who through the decades shift from teetotalers to civil libertarians, but always retain those constants of every Chandler hero: a chance at redemption.</p>
<p>Also appearing at the Salon is Howard Prouty (Acquisitions Archivist at The Academy Foundation/Margaret Herrick Library and proprietor ofÂ <a href="https://www.readinkbooks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReadInk</a>) with a talk on Jake Zeitlin, another in his ongoing Salon series on important booksellers in Los Angeles. And before and after the formal dinner and Salon presentations, guests will mingle with Hollywood historian Philip Mershon (proprietor ofÂ <a href="https://www.felixinhollywoodtours.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Felix in Hollywood Tour Company</a>) and actressÂ <a style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-size: 12px;" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1140069/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasey Wilson</a>, appearing in the character of the helpful female book clerk from <em>The Big Sleep</em>.</p>
<h3>THE BACK STORY</h3>
<p>For much of the mid-20th Century, to rub shoulders with Americaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s greatest novelists and screenwriters, one needed merely to go to the corner of Cherokee Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. Here, within the tight triangle of the Writerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Guild offices, Musso &amp; Frank Grill and the Stanley Rose Bookshop, flowed the commercial and social sap that nourished the tree of American letters. The famous minds who congregated still inspire awe: William Faulkner, Scott Fitzgerald, John Fante, Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, William Saroyan, John Oâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Hara, Dorothy Parker, Nathanael West and many more.</p>
<p>And at the center of it all was the famed â€œBack Roomâ€ of Musso &amp; Frank, the oldest restaurant in Hollywood. Beginning in 1936, in response to the restaurantâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s growing popularity, Mussoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s expanded its operations into a small room tucked behind the Vogue Theater. A door was punched through the west wall of the dining room, and a haughty door man installed. His instructions were simple: the back room was to be the exclusive domain of Hollywoodâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s literary lions, their friends and romantic partners. It was called, informally, The Cocktail Room or The Round Table or the Algonquin West.</p>
<p>The party raged on, six nights a week, for twenty glorious years.</p>
<p>In 1955, Musso &amp; Frank expanded to the east, and the contents of the â€œBack Roomâ€â€”the long bar, chairs, light fixtures, coat racksâ€”were moved wholesale into the â€œNew Room.â€ The â€œNew Roomâ€ was no longer the exclusive retreat of literary Los Angeles, but the writers kept coming. Today, Musso &amp; Frankâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s clientele still includes celebrated novelists, screenwriters, poets and songwriters, all of whom cherish the old world hospitality, traditional Continental cuisine and opportunity to soak up the same rarified air that nourished the greats.</p>
<p>In honor of this ongoing writerly tradition, LAVA (The Los Angeles Visionaries Association) is delighted to announce the January 2012 launch of The LAVA Salon at Musso &amp; Frank, a quarterly literary salon and prix fixe dinner celebrating the great writers and personalities who have frequented the establishment. The LAVA Salon at Musso &amp; Frank is the brainchild of Kim Cooper &amp; Richard Schave, proprietors of literary tour company <a href="https://www.esotouric.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esotouric</a>â€”Raymond Chandlerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Los Angeles, James M. Cainâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Southern California Nightmare, Charles Bukowskiâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Haunts of a Dirty Old Man, John Fanteâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Dreams from Bunker Hillâ€”who for the past twenty months have been hosting a free cultural Salon on the last Sunday of the month at Cliftonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Cafeteria (recently moved to the Los Angeles Athletic Club). With this new Salon series, LAVA expands its congenial, intelligent and unpredictable cultural programming into Hollywood with a quarterly literary Salon event held in Musso &amp; Frank on a night when the restaurant is closed to the general public. Seating is extremely limited, and this intimate gathering is sure to sell out quickly.</p>
<p>LAVA co-founder Richard Schave, the Salon host and co-curator, says â€œI would argue that along the bar in the old Cocktail Room, somewhere between the drinking, bragging, fighting and general hell-raising, the better half of the Hard-Boiled School of American Letters was hashed out and put down on paper. The purpose of the Salon is two fold. First, to set the record straight on some basic milestones: the rise and fall of the original Cocktail Room and its reincarnation as the â€œNew Roomâ€ and the symbiotic relationship Musso &amp; Frank shared with the legendary bookshop next door, Stanley Roseâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s. Secondly, a more ephemeral aim: in these hallowed rooms, that still bear the nicotine stains from Raymond Chandlerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s pipe and Charles Bukowskiâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s cigarettes, we want to seek out and amplify the spark which all those great souls have left behind. Musso &amp; Frank is just bricks and mortar, but incredible ideas and connections were forged here, and we believe that spark is waiting to be reignited and make its impression felt in Los Angeles again.â€</p>
<p>Each Mussoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Salon evening will focus on different aspects of Hollywoodâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s literary lore, feature fascinating speakers and special guest historians, and be hosted by LAVA co-founder Richard Schave.</p>
<p>Mark Echeverria, 4th generation General Manager/Proprietor of The Musso &amp; Frank Grill, says â€œFor 93 years The Musso &amp; Frank Grill has been a keystone in Hollywoodâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s ever-evolving history. Some of the worldâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s greatest people have walked through our doors, sat at a booth or a bar stool, and dreamt the unimaginable. That is what makes Hollywood so unique: unimaginable things come true. Musso &amp; Frank Grill has always been that inspiration in peopleâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s lives to make the impossible, possible, and it is now time to tell the true story of the people who put Hollywood on the map, and the restaurant they did it inâ€”The Musso &amp; Frank Grill. We are extremely excited to work with LAVA to bring you living history in a setting where history continues to happen, even 93 years later. So please enjoy an authentic dinning experience you would have found in the early decades of last century, and bring yourselves back to the time era of the literary giants, and truly get a journey through the history of Hollywood, in the restaurant that Hollywood grew up around, The Musso &amp; Frank Grill.â€</p>
<p>Future Salons will focus on the life and works of Charles Bukowski, F.Scott Fitzgerald, Dorothy Parker, Nathanael West and other fascinating characters whoâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve contributed to nearly a century of literary culture at Musso &amp; Frank.</p>

    <ul>
<li>Since September of 2013 Angels Flight has been closed due to a regulatory decision, not because of mechanical problems.
<li>The Angels Flight Friends and Neighbors Society is a grassroots group that has mobilized to advocate for a return to service of Angels Flight Railway.
<li>In response to this group&#8217;s petition campaign, Mayor Eric Garcetti has called on the MTA to produce a report about Angels Flight, and members of his staff are pursuing a solution to the regularity issues.
<li>Following the six-hour derailment in September of 2013, where nobody was injured and there was only about $6,000 in damage to Angels Flight property, replacement equipment was installed and tested in early 2014.
<li>Angels Flight connects the Red Lineâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Pershing Square station portal at Fourth and Hill Streets with the top of Bunker Hill.
<li>When operating in public service, Angels Flight averaged 1,200 to 1,500 passenger trips every day, operating from 6:45 in the morning until 10:00 at night.
<li>That is almost 6 million riders from 1996-2001 &#038; 2010-2013
<li>For the last three years of its operation Angels Flight gave Metro riders using a TAP Card a 50% fare reduction.
<li>Angels Flight is a vital part of the Los Angeles County public transportation system.

Poor Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria!&nbsp;The Downtown L.A. landmark hasn&#8217;t even reopened yet after its four year, multi-million dollar restoration / reinvention, yet it&#8217;s already received a <a href="https://www.vice.com/read/las-old-pay-what-you-wish-cafeteria-is-reopening-as-a-restaurant-for-yuppies-511" target="_blank" style="word-wrap: break-word;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #6DC6DD;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">blistering review</a> from Megan Koester, a comedienne who attended the VIP press preview.&nbsp;
<p>
But the trouble with Clifton&#8217;s isn&#8217;t that it&#8217;s been closed for 1446 days (and didn&#8217;t re-open <a href="https://la.eater.com/2015/9/21/9366893/cliftons-cafeteria-official-opening-date-delayed-coming" target="_blank" style="word-wrap: break-word;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #6DC6DD;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">as planned</a> last week), that it&#8217;s too expensive now, that the old gang doesn&#8217;t go there anymore or that the updates wrecked the joint.&nbsp;
<p>
No, the trouble with Clifton&#8217;s is that people care so darn much about it that they can barely contain themselves. This might be the first, but it won&#8217;t be the last bad review.&nbsp;
<p>
And we can certainly relate to Ms. Koester&#8217;s passion. For as long as we&#8217;ve been giving tours and exploring the lost history of Los Angeles, Clifford Clinton&#8217;s magnificent cafeteria has been our home in the heart of the city. Among its artificial pines and waterfalls, we hosted cultural Salons and Thanksgiving dinners, developed new tours, toasted visitors and marked important personal milestones.&nbsp;
<p>
And as we&#8217;ve fought to preserve historic landmarks and build a creative community, so much of that work at Clifton&#8217;s, we started to feel like the long-dead Clifford Clintonâ€”gadfly, visionary, muckraker, activist, feeder of the hungry and builder of worlds<span style="color: #545454;font-family: arial,sans-serif;font-size: small;line-height: 20.2222px;">â€”</span>was a mentor, maybe even a friend. We&#8217;d often ask ourselves <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/los-angeles-cliftons-cafeteria-reopening-recalls-an-older-communal-spirit-the-city-could-benefit-from-once-more-10509191.html" target="_blank" style="word-wrap: break-word;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #6DC6DD;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;What would Clifford Clinton do?&#8221;</a>
<p>
And that never stopped, even when the big glass doors swung shut for the last time on September 25, 2011.
<p>
Now Clifton&#8217;s is coming back<span style="color: #545454;font-family: arial,sans-serif;font-size: small;line-height: 20.2222px;">â€”</span>changed, but not, we think, too much. We&#8217;ve toured every floor, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153616262964596.1073741939.8040854595&amp;type=3" target="_blank" style="word-wrap: break-word;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #6DC6DD;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">found</a> the familiar spaces brightened and the new spaces beguiling.
<p>
Megan Koester loved Clifton&#8217;s, too, and she&#8217;s convinced herself that she and the old patrons, who she remembers as being homeless people and drug addicts, won&#8217;t be welcomed back.
<p>
Four years is a long time, though, and memories can play peculiar tricks.&nbsp;
<p>
The truth is that at the time it closed, the dominant demographic of Clifton&#8217;s patrons was working families (weekends) and the elderly poor (every day). If there were a lot of homeless or junkie patrons, you certainly couldn&#8217;t tell by looking at them. And in any case, everyone who came in the door, including the man who&#8217;d leave his bunny rabbit in a baby carriage on the terrazzo sidewalk out front, was treated as an honored guest, and allowed to linger over their meal, however modest. The closure left a big hole in Downtown.
<p>

We would be very surprised if the affordable, welcoming cafeteria doesn&#8217;t act as a loss leader for the more profitable, upscale venues up- and downstairs. The architectural division of leaving the historic cafeteria spaces largely unchanged, while creating ambitious new venues in unfamiliar parts of the building, suggests that this is the logic behind the project.&nbsp;
<p>
A critical article like Megan Koester&#8217;s can be hard to read, but it clearly comes from a place of love<span style="line-height:20.8px">â€”</span>what the urban preservation theorists call <a href="https://news.californiapreservation.org/extraordinary-vs-ordinary/" target="_blank" style="word-wrap: break-word;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #6DC6DD;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Affective Ownership</a>. It&#8217;s normal to fret about changes to Clifton&#8217;s if you adore the place. We think it&#8217;s too early to say what the new Clifton&#8217;s will be like, but if it isn&#8217;t a melting pot for all kinds of Angelenos, then it will be fair for critics and patrons to call that out.&nbsp;
<p>
Personally, we&#8217;re hopeful. Let&#8217;s take it <strong>one bowl of Jell-O at a time</strong>, and give the new Clifton&#8217;s a chance to exceed our varied, and valid, expectations.
<p>
The trouble with Clifton&#8217;s? Clifton&#8217;s is dearly beloved. Oh, to have such troubles!&nbsp;
<p>
Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria re-opensâ€”for real, this timeâ€”at 11am on Thursday, October 1. We&#8217;ll be there with bells on, and open minds. So if you see us, give us a jingle.
