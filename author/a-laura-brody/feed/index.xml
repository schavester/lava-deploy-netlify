										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spend an afternoon shopping for fabric the first day, then learn to construct a unique garment on a human form on the next. Students who take part in both workshops will get a full day of stapling and draping instruction, followed by personal guidance on pattern making and sewing your garment. Class is taught by LAVA Visionary A. Laura Brody.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Part One: Fabric day- Saturday, May 17th, 11:30 AM- 3:30 PM. $15</p>
<p>Part Two: Drape and Sew- Sunday, May 18th, 10 AM- 4 PM. $45</p>
<p>Try both parts and save! It&#8217;s $50 for both workshops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Day 1 â€“ Fabric day! We&#8217;ll meet at 11:30 AM in LA&#8217;s garment district in front of Michael Levine, the enormous fabric depot. Thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s cheap parking off of 9th Street and Maple near the store.</p>
<p><a title="Michael Levine" href="https://www.lowpricefabric.com/t-contact.aspx" target="_blank">Michael Levine </a>has a main store, a home decor store across the street and The Loft upstairs where all fabric is $2.50 a pound. After Michael Levineâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s, we will check out some favorite nearby fabric shops. For those who canâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t get enough shiny, right off of 8th Street is Berger Beads Specialty, home of all that is sparkly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Day 2 â€“ Stapling, draping and sewing day! We&#8217;ll meet at 10 AM at <a title="EVE Studio" href="https://www.erynvalentinastudio.com/contact/" target="_blank">EVE Studio</a>, 3923 W. 6th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90020 Suite #211. Parking is tricky but free on Sundays.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll drape and staple in the morning, then clean up the patterns and sew in the afternoon. Students will create garments on each other and finish them by the end of the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Staplers, staples, scissors, pins, thread, extra fabrics, an ironing board and iron, an overlock machine and 2-3 sewing machines will be provided. If you have a portable sewing machine, please bring it along! That way, no one has to wait for a machine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s time once more to learn staple draping with Fashion on the Fly!</p>
<p>Staple draping is a fun, fast and effective technique for creating  anything made of material.  And I mean anything, from upholstery to car  covers to clothes. &nbsp;(No, we will not bring your car into the classroom. Yes, we can drape it in the parking lot.) You&#8217;ll learn to make your own shapes and patterns, and even learn how to alter your clothes to make them fit and look better. If enough folks are interested, we&#8217;ll do a duct-tape mannequin session.  This way you can staple drape yourself at home without straining to reach your own back.</p>
<p>FASHION ON THE FLY CLASS SCHEDULE:<br /> Saturdays, June 29, July 13 and July 20 (no class July 6th)<br /> TIME: 12 PM- 3 PM<br /> COST: $45 (due at registration) plus $20 materials fee for scissors, fabrics, staples and a stapler.<br /> AGES: 16 years and older</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><p>This Sunday night at 8pm, either outdoors in front of a fire and an inflatable movie screen in the Silver Lake Bowl (if it&#8217;s a hot night) OR indoors in front of a fire in Roger&#8217;s movie theater (if it&#8217;s cool), we are proud to present to you: The Event Formerly Known as Nerd Nite! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Nerd Nite is a series of informative and entertaining audio-visual talks where community speakers share some of their intense interests and areas of professional or lay expertise. &nbsp;(Apparently there is a real organization that uses this name, and we are not that organization, which is why our event is now &#8220;formerly known as&#8230;&#8221;) &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our first speaker is Meagan Ramsey, who works as a medical social worker and also is a Gallery Interpreter at the LA County Natural History Museum. &nbsp;She will talk about spiders, and ask the question: &#8220;Aversions to spiders are incredibly common in Western culture, but why do we fear them when other cultures do not?&#8221; &nbsp;Sheâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll examine the roots of this fear, explore spider &#8216;101&#8217; and â€˜fact vs. fictionâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, along the way identifying our local spider species and whether they deserve our shrieks and shivers.</p>
<p>Our second speaker is Erica Li, a newly minted MD who works as a pediatrics resident at Harbor UCLA. &nbsp;She and her slide show will discuss reproduction and sex differentiation, and ask the question: &#8220;When you were an embryo, how did your body know whether to develop male or female genitals? &nbsp;What did your genes say to your forming gonads, and what did they in turn say to your budding genitalia?&#8221; &nbsp;And: &#8220;How do people with Disorders of Sexual Differentiation shed light upon our perception of maleness and femaleness?&#8221;</p>
<p>Our third speaker is LAVA Visionary Laura Brody, a costume designer, who will talk about (and demonstrate) her specialty design and construction method: staple draping! &nbsp;Using re-used fabrics, staplers, scissors and basic geometry, she&#8217;ll show you how to create clothing on the fly. &nbsp;Brave volunteers, come and let her staple you!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So &#8211; bring your family, friends, and perhaps a bottle of something to drink, and come learn and enjoy.</p>
<p>Please register for your free ticket!</p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you want to make your own clothing designs? Want to create wearable art, but donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t know how to start?&nbsp;Ever looked at a commercial pattern in shock and horror? Or know how to  make clothes and want to free yourself from boring designs? Then this is for you.</p>
<p> <strong>Staple draping is:&nbsp;Making your own garments on a real live person, using leftover fabrics,  a stapler, staples and scissors.</strong> When youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re done, take your stapled  work of art and use it to make a pattern, take out the staples and sew  it together or just cover the staples in duct tape and go out in old  school punk rock style. You made it! Itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s yours to play with.&nbsp;You can do this even if youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve never sewn a seam. Or if you sew all the time and are tired of all the rules.</p>
