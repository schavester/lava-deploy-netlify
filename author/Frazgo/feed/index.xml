										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The October 12 and 13th event will take place in Monrovia&#8217;s Historic Old Town in Library Park. This will be the 50th Anniversary of the event.</p>
<p>Celebrate the Arts is a juried fine art event that encompasses a variety of media from flat art to three dimensional. &nbsp;The event is well received in the community. Even the jewelry artists have strict criteria and their work must be wearable art, not simple bead stringing from commercially sourced resources.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve served as Jury coordinator for the event since 2005 and developed the jury criteria which was implemented in 2006 and serves as the Monrovia Association of Fine Arts guide in bringing in new talent.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">If any LAVA members want to showcase their art at the Celebrate the Arts please contact me directly and I will work with the Show coordinator to get you in and a display space in. &nbsp;Late fee will be waived if you are in place by 9/25/2013.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Monrovia Association of Fine Arts is a group of people from the area that bring art and art education to a variety of communities and schools in the San Gabriel Valley.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Frank Zgonc is a photographer with many artistic passions.&nbsp; Photography was among the earliest but he also ventured into the graphic arts and a variety of painting mediums.&nbsp; These interests have been nurtured side by side over the years.&nbsp; The initial Associate of Arts in Commercial Art and Illustration lead to pursuing his photographic training and education.&nbsp; He completed a 4 year BS degree in Commercial Photography from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This education and interest in art was applied to commercial ventures after completing college.&nbsp; His experience allowed him to pursue journalistic and advertising photography for Las Vegan Magazine.&nbsp; These exposures lead to his being contracted by American Borate Company to photograph and then design their marketing magazine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">Even with a detour and venture into retail management and the insurance industry he never abandoned photography.</span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">It remained a passion and avenue for creative expression. During that time his energies were devoted to working on Fine Art photography with a focus landscapes and nature.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">â€œLife is about exploring, art is telling the world what we foundâ€ is a philosophy applied to his art whether it be painting, digital art or photography.</span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">He uses these mediums to not record what he saw, rather communicate the relationships and emotions of the subject in the final image.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">These passions to communicate those relationships and emotions have been explored through the â€œwatercolor photographyâ€ process.</span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">In its simplest terms its working with images so they will print on wet watercolor paper.</span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">This process produces impressionistic images that enhance the communication of the sense of place and emotions in the subjects.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">Frank has found that the use of the personal computer and a variety of imaging programs has led to faster and new ways to communicate what he saw through the camera.</span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">No longer confined to the time consuming processes need to produce an image in silver based media as enable him to be out more often photographing the world around him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">Frank has shown at a variety of galleries locally and is a listed artist at the Saatchi Gallery in </span>London<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">.</span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">He is past president on the Monrovia Association of Fine Arts, and serves currently as a Board Member and Vice President.</span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">He was the featured artist for the MAFA Celebrate the Arts Festival </span>October 11-12,2008<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">His art and writing is done under the nom de plum â€œfrazgoâ€.</span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">His artistic explorations may be followed at his blog: https://frazgomeanders.blogspot.com/, that blog was named last year as one of KCBS&#8217;s top 20 blogs in </span>Los Angeles<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">.</span></p>
