										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writer and social historian Joan Renner explores the dark side of Southern California in a presentation focusing on crime photos from the Herald-Examiner collection, with material drawn from two fascinating stories covered by legendary Los Angeles newswoman, Agness â€œAggieâ€ Underwood. One of the cases to be presented is the mysterious death of film star Thelma Todd in 1935. Also presented will be the tale of Helen Wills Love, who, after committing murder on New Year&#8217;s Eve in 1936, willed herself into a coma!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To sign up for this FREE event: All you need to do is arrive at Traxx Bar in Union Station by 7:00 pm. The tour will leave promptly at 7:00 pm and will take approximately 45-60 minutes. </p>
<p>ABOUT THIS EVENT:  For three days, May 3-5, 1939, Angelenos celebrated the long awaited opening of Union Station with parades, performances, and speeches. This week marks the station&#8217;s 73rd anniversary, so please join the Art Deco Society of Los Angeles for Cocktails in Historic Places and a tour of a much loved Los Angeles landmark.</p>
<p>Union Station, known as the &#8220;Last Great Train Station&#8221;, was originally the site of Los Angeles&#8217; Chinatown. For many years Chinatown was considered to be a hot bed of sin, and there had been numerous political and social campaigns to demolish it. Drug busts, prostitution, white slavery, and tales of underground opium dens frightened, and titillated, the residents of the City of Angels. </p>
<p>After nearly two decades of court battles among the City of Los Angeles, the railroads, and the Chinese residents, Union Station was constructed on a foundation strong enough to withstand powerful earthquakes; but, it was also built on a foundation of shady real estate deals and political corruption.</p>
<p>Please join the Art Deco Society of Los Angeles for Cocktails in Historic Places in Traxx Bar on Friday, May 4, 2012 at 6 pm.  At 7 pm we will gather for an informal tour which will include a brief history of the station, and its architecture, led by Joan Renner, LAVA member and ADSLA board member.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What motivates a woman to become a criminal?  Are some women just born bad, or are they driven to commit crimes for, or because of, the men in their lives?  Felonious Flappers will explore the lives and crimes of some of the baddest girls in Los Angeles, from actress and writer Dorothy Mackaye to the ironically named Helen Love.</p>
<p>What is it about Los Angeles that brings out the evil in a woman?  Crime writer Raymond Chandler speculated that a local weather phenomenon could cause a woman to contemplate murder:   â€œThere was a desert wind blowing that night. It was one of those hot dry Santa Anas that come down through the mountain passes and curl your hair and make your nerves jump and your skin itch. On nights like that every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbandsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> necks. Anything can happen. You can even get a full glass of beer at a cocktail lounge.â€</p>
<p>Whether itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s the climate, their greed, or that theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re just plain evil, curvy killers have always been a part of the fabric of Los Angeles.  You may empathize with the femme fatales, or find them repellent, but you are sure to be fascinated by them.</p>
<p>Social historian and writer Joan Renner will present an illustrated lecture which will explore the cases of a few Los Angeles women who found themselves on the wrong side of the law during the Art Deco era.</p>
<p>Presentation will be followed by a rare theatrical screening of the pre-code â€œlady criminal filmâ€ THE LADIES THEY TALK ABOUT starring Barbara Stanwyck.</p>
