					<description><![CDATA[Hollywood needs to be more mindful of its history.  So many remnants of its glorious past have been carelessly destroyed and discarded in the name of progress and business.  Saving and preserving the RKO Globe, which towered over one of the great Hollywood studios during the golden era, is a small endeavor compared to the backlots, sets and soundstages that have already been demolished.  Please learn from past errors and save this beautiful sculpture for future generations of fans and filmmakers.  Thank you from a dedicated fan of RKO.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I remember the original park.  I would stay at the Biltmore with my parents and walk through the park under the shade trees to the hotel.  Later I was appalled at what had been done to the park after the garage was installed.  The same thing happened to the Civic Center Park in San Francisco when a garage was installed.  The lesson is that putting a garage under a park doesn&#039;t usually work out good for the park.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Why in the world wouldn&#039;t you want to keep an historical structure.  If indeed you wish to remodel... great, but not at the expense, destruction of something that represents so much of the past in our film and entertainment town.... known all over the world!  Let&#039;s not forget who and what events paid into this community.  Keep the history. Keep our past image.  Keep our reminder of (maybe) a more glamorous day.  However you need to say it, read it.... reconsider the possibility of RESPECTING what once was.

Thanks much for your wanting to improve... but keep visual memories.]]></description>
