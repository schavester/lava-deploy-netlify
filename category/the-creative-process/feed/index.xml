<p>On the last Sunday of each month, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather on the third floor of the historic Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria in Downtown Los Angeles (noon-2pm), for a loosely structured conversational Salon featuring short presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another. If you&#8217;re interested in joining LAVA as a creative contributor or an attendee, we recommend Salon attendance as an introduction to this growing community. We also recommend the shortbread.</p>
<p>Special program at the July 31 Salon:</p>
<p>â€¢ LAVA Visionaries Maja D&#8217;Aoust, Librarian at the Philosophical Research Society and host of the July 30 Esotouric bus adventure Maja&#8217;s Mysteries: Rapture &amp; Release, and Rev. Paul Nugent of The Aetherius Society will host a joint presentation / conversation on the history of Los Angeles as a magnetic spiritual center: a place where people of all faiths and backgrounds have come to seek enlightenment since the turn of the last century. Maja will introduce us to some of the major esoteric groups and thinkers that have made Los Angeles their home, revealing the shared aims beneath a seemingly disparate collection of seekers. These will include The Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), Manly P. Hall and his Philosophical Research Society and The Theosophy Society, to name a few. Then Paul will give a brief history of The Aetherius Society, the spiritual organization which was brought to Los Angeles by Yoga Master and extraterrestrial contactee Dr. George King in 1959, as part of his mission to help humanity raise itself from universal suffering and ignorance. Dr. King&#8217;s initial communication with the Cosmic Master Aetherius occurred in 1954, spurring Dr. King on to found the Society in England the following year (he ran it until his death in 1997; Paul Nugent was a personal assistant to Dr. King and is a current Director of the organization&#8217;s American headquarters). Part of the work of The Aetherius Society is predicated on Prayer, and the mental direction of positive energy towards the world&#8217;s trouble spots in a manifestation of the concept that consciousness can impact objective reality. The presentation will provide an overview of the Southland&#8217;s fascinating spiritual history and ongoing role in the development of new religious thought and action.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The project is a Re-purposed Circus in Baraboo, WI (Circus City, USA). Itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s the birthplace of the American circus and former home of the Ringling Brothers, now home to Circus World Museum.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Heidi Dakter and I were asked to create performances and workshops for the Summerset Festival of the Arts in Baraboo, Wisconsin. Heidi came from there, I have friends there and we were thrilled. We came up with a repurposed circus parade, using my live draping to transform old circus materials onto the townspeople and the lead clowns and ringmaster from Circus World. Heidi has created a series of memory boxes incorporating old materials and memorabilia into little dioramas, I make garments on live bodies by stapling old fabrics into new garments- itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a perfect combination for making repurposed arts workshops.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We put together ideas for 2 gallery shows from local sources: the fabulous collection of old circus costumes of Circus Worldâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Museum, pieces from the renowned American Playerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Theater and Dr. Evermoreâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s beautifully odd salvaged mechanical creatures.

Sometimes it takes an outside perspective to get people to see whatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s in their own backyardsâ€¦</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, Wisconsinâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s been going through some difficulties with state funding (you may have heard about the protests) and while the Festival still wants us there, they didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t know about spending the money to bring in outside talent.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And this is where Kickstarter comes in! Weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve contacted people and already started this process, and just donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t want to let it lie. If we can possibly bring ourselves there, with the help of interested and fabulous folksâ€¦</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why not?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks so much, thanks to Kim and Richard and merry spring!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Laura</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Links! Please share the link to the project- weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d love to get as many people as possible checking us out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been gently reminded by both Kim and Richard that I&#8217;ve been remiss in keeping my fellow Visionaries up to date. The problem is, as usual, that I&#8217;m doing more than I&#8217;m writing about what I&#8217;m doing. Much of the drama gets lost in the business of the moment.<br />I&#8217;ll do my best to write more during the process instead of after the fact. I&#8217;ve got to warn you, though. It&#8217;s a little hard to keep up. For now, I&#8217;ll give you a little month to month precis.</p>
<p>August and September were mostly about Diavolo Dance Theater and creating the SteamWalker, aka Le Flaneur. It&#8217;s the second installment in my Opulent Mobility series and includes a tasseled cushion and parasol, a chafing dish nestling a GPS unit and cow horns in front. Oh, and a bud vase. You may have to look at the pictures.</p>
<p>I worked on Diavolo&#8217;s adaptation of <em>Fearful Symmetries</em> on and off from June through September, but Aug-Sept were the push times since the show opened at the Bowl on September 9th. Naturally, my completed submission of the Steamwalker for the <em>Steampunk Form and Function</em> design competition was due Sept. 4th and the walker needed to be ready to ship out to Massachusetts before I left for Kansas City on Sept. 29th. Did I mention that August was also filled with finishing crafts for <em>Toy Story on Ice</em> and September was also devoted to prepping patterns (with designer Michael Schmidt) for Steven Tyler&#8217;s debut on <em>American Idol?</em></p>
<p>Got to pay the bills somehow.</p>
<p>At any rate, <em>Toy Story</em> is now <em>on Ice.</em> Steve Tyler hasn&#8217;t yet worn anything I&#8217;ve made on <em>American Idol,</em> but it will happen. Diavolo&#8217;s <em>Fearful Symmetries</em> went up and down <a href="(https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-0911-phil-dance-pictures,0,5346715.photogallery" target="_blank">without a hitch</a> at the Hollywood Bowl and the Steamwalker is safely on display at the Charles River Museum of Industry and Innovation through May 2011. Pictures from the exhibit are up now <a href="https://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/album.php?aid=34597&amp;id=104974332881287" target="_blank">on Facebook</a>, and you can find the exhibit online <a href="https://www.crmi.org/exhibits/temporary-exhibits-at-crmi/steampunk-form-and-function-an-exhibition-of-innovation-invention-gadgetry/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>For the next installment-<br />I&#8217;ll tell you what&#8217;s up to date in Kansas City!<br />(I hear it&#8217;s everything.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>WHAT: Visionary Gene Sculatti exhibits his scrolls at the LAVA Sunday Salon, March 28, 1pm at Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria. <a href="/salon310" target="_blank">More info</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never engaged in this kind of thing before: publicly promoting these scrolls or &#8220;cityscapes&#8221; as <a href="/user/5" target="_blank">Kim</a> calls them. But here&#8217;s the deal: On and off since I was 9 or so (I&#8217;m now 63), I have done pen-and-crayon (with some watercolor) drawings of imaginary cities, mostly informed by the way L.A., S.F. and California appear to a largely untrained illustrator.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re full of streets and buildings, people, freeways and beaches, power plants and broad, palm-lined arterials. They&#8217;re mostly drawn on white shelf-lining paper, and the longest one (1960-62) is 60 yards long. Because they were drawn over many years, they in effect comprise a rough chronological snapshot of what (mostly) Cali has looked like to me: sprawling suburban tracts announced by&nbsp;&#8220;Vets No Down!&#8221; billboards (60s), the mansard-roofs of fast-food franchises (70s), theater and concert venues whose marquees hype long gone films and idealized pop-music bills.</p>
<p>Somehow, though, it is, like the <a href="https://www.luxuriamusic.com/atomic-cocktail-0" target="_blank">weekly radio show</a> I do, all sort of contemporaneous, the accretion of architecture, signage and sensibility&nbsp;all meant to bear the time signature of the eternal Now, which, I suppose, is a key part of the California Dream that informed my growing up and lifelong residence here. I started the latest cityscape,&nbsp;&#8220;Majestic Blvd.,&#8221; in February 2006 when I lost my last real job. It&#8217;s just under 60 feet now and growing. I will also bring and show one scroll of earlier vintage.</p>
