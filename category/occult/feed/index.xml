										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Crown City masquerades as a calm and refined retreat, where well-bred ladies glide around their perfect bungalows and everyone knows what fork to use first. But don&#8217;t be fooled by appearances. Dip into the confidential files of old Pasadena and meet assassins and oddballs, kidnappers and slashers, Satanists and all manner of maniac in a delightful little tour you WON&#8217;T find recommended by the better class of people! From celebrated cases like the RFK assassination (with a visit to Sirhan Sirhan&#8217;s folks&#8217; house), &#8220;Eraserhead&#8221; star Jack Nance&#8217;s strange end, black magician/rocket scientist Jack Parsons&#8217; death-by-misadventure and the 1926 Rose Parade grand stand collapse, to fascinating obscurities, the tour&#8217;s dozens of murders, arsons, kidnappings, robberies, suicides, auto wrecks and oddball happening sites provide a alternate history of Pasadena that&#8217;s as fascinating as it is creepy. Passengers will tour the old Millionaire&#8217;s Row on Orange Grove, thrill to the shocking Sphinx Murder on the steps of the downtown Masonic Hall and discover why people named Judd should think twice before moving to Pasadena.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Please note that, due to limited room capacity, attendees must register to attend the <span class="caps">LAVA</span> Sunday Salon</strong>. To sign up for this free event: First <a href="user/register">register</a> as a user on this site, or <a href="user/login">login</a> to your existing account and then return to this page. Refresh the page and the signup field will appear just to the left of this text. Enter your email address. No plus-ones; each guest must register individually. If you find you are unable to attend, please return to this page and cancel your reservation. <strong>Also, note that the Sunday Salon has a new time slot: 2-4pm</strong>.</p>
<p>Architectural Historian <a href="https://www.insroland.org/user/653" target="_blank">Nathan Marsak</a>, the <a href="/lavavisionary2015" target="_blank">LAVA Visionary of the Year for 2015</a>,&nbsp;presents on the forgotten architectural landscape of nineteenth-century Los Angelesâ€”a lost world whose most salient impulse was toward the imposing, rough-hewn blocks of the Romanesque.</p>
<p>The common narrative regarding the visual development of early Los Angeles usually involves the native vernacular of the pueblo, which one may still visit in any number of extant adobes; from there, following some historic boom times, we Angelenos and visitors alike are regaled by the wondrous Beaux-Arts high-rises of downtown. If pure Victorian architecture is considered, one likely turns attention to the Eastlake and Queen Anne examples along Carroll Avenue, or to the used-car lot of gingerbread, Heritage Square.</p>
<p>This does a disservice, asserts Marsak, to the wonderland of Richardsonian Romanesque, Romanesque Revival, and Romanesque-hybrid office blocks and civic structures that once defined our city. A confluence of money and local pride, primarily in the late-1880s, resulted in what was arguably Americaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s greatest center of the style, short-lived though it may have been. The ethos of the City Beautiful movement, skyscraper construction, and other factors contributed to its demise.</p>
<p>It is especially striking that these structures, whose construction exuded solidity and permanence, should have been removed on so great a scale. Besides illuminating twenty of the most notable lost masterpieces, Marsakâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s lecture will visit those few remaining examples of the style. Attention will be given as well to the styles that fought for dominance in defining Victorian Los Angeles, e.g., French Empire.</p>

<p>Please note that, due to limited&nbsp;room capacity, attendees must register to attend the LAVA Sunday Salon.&nbsp;No plus-ones; each guest must register individually.

<p>Join LAVA Visionary and&nbsp;art historian <a href="https://empiredelamort.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Paul Koudounaris</a>, author of &#8220;<a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0500251959" target="_blank">Heavenly Bodies: Cult Treasures and Spectacular Saints from the Catacombs</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0500251789" target="_blank">The Empire of Death: A Cultural History of Ossuaries and Charnel Houses</a>&#8221; for a very special presentation&nbsp;inaugurating the relaunch of the monthly <span class="caps">LAVA</span> Sunday Salon at <a href="https://librarybarla.com/" target="_blank">Library Bar</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Demonically-Possessed Cats with Dr. Paul Koudounaris</strong></p>
<p>Does your cat do things like:</p>
<p>spit fire?</p>
<p>speak in tongues?</p>
<p>levitate?</p>
<p>shape shift?</p>
<p>wantonly kill people for no apparent reason?</p>
<p>This behavior may be more than simple bad kitty syndromeâ€”your cat may be possessed by a demon. But donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t worry, youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re not alone. In fact, there is an entire history of demonically-possessed cats. Felines were once considered by theologians to be easy prey for demons, who could enter their bodies and wreck incredible havoc on mankind. And did you knowâ€¦ demonically-possessed cats are still believed to be with us today?! Dr. Paul Koudounaris has immersed himself in the study of demonic cats, in order to to give a talk on this sadly neglected topic. Cat lovers will like this lecture, and cat haters will like it even more. Neither side will ever look at a domestic cat the same way again.</p>
<p>Please note this lecture has been given by Dr. Koudounaris in abbreviated forms about town, but this <em>only</em> time he will present the full lecture in Los Angeles.</p>

You&#8217;ll hear about Raymond Chandler&#8217;s pre-literary life as an oil company executive, the idealistic L.A. policeman who is a likely model for Philip Marlowe, the real woman who inspired the character of Chandler&#8217;s secretary Muriel, and the terrible secrets revealed by the fraud investigation in the Great Eleven&#8217;s activities.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Tahoma, 'DejaVu Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em;">Richard will share insights into how he used cutting edge computing tools to evoke the look and feel of a mid-century book, and Kim will talk abut the deluxe Art Deco wraps created for the Subscribers, whose pre-publication support covered a big chunk of the print cost. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Tahoma, 'DejaVu Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em;">The talk will be followed by a Q&amp;A, and copies of &#8220;The Kept Girl&#8221;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Tahoma, 'DejaVu Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.thekeptgirl.com/2014/09/chandlermap.html" target="_blank">&#8220;The Raymond Chandler Map of Los Angeles&#8221;</a>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Tahoma, 'DejaVu Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em;">will be available for purchase and signing by the author.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past decade, Dr. Paul Koudounaris has been documenting famous   macabre sites and researching our cultural relationship with death,   producing two books, <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0500251789" target="_blank">Empire of Death</a></em> and <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0500251959" target="_blank">Heavenly Bodies</a></em>, which have found great acclaim and a cult following. Those books were mostly confined  to  Europe, however. His forthcoming book, <em>Memento Mori</em>, will be his  most  ambitious, expanding his subject matter to a global level and  presenting  little known macabre sanctuaries in Asia, Africa, and South  America. He  will give a peek at the new material tonight in a special  lecture for  the Brand Library, taking the audience on a world tour,  from burial  caves in Indonesia to gilded corpses in Taiwan to skull  festivals in  Bolivia to decorated skeletons in Germany . . . the  world&#8217;s most  spectacular macabre sites will be opened up to the  audience with a  spectacular slideshow of his own photos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>An important message from LAVA &#8211; September 9, 2014</strong></p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>It is with no small amount of regret that we are putting the monthly LAVA Sunday Salon and Broadway on My Mind walking tour series on hiatus, effective immediately. Both events take place at Les Noces du Figaro restaurant, which is closing down for several months of renovations.</p>
<p>We will be working closely with Jonathan Mgaieth of Figaro to determine a relaunch date as soon as the restaurant reopens, hopefully in early 2015. So stay tuned, and we hope to see you at other LAVA events in the meantime.</p>
<p>Please know that your continued thoughts and good will are the rock upon which LAVA builds its house.</p>
<p>With thanks for your understanding, we remain,<br />Richard Schave and Kim Cooper<br />LAVA &#8211; The Los Angeles Visionaries Association</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Join&nbsp;<span class="caps">LAVA</span>&nbsp;for our revived free monthly Sunday Salon series. We return to South Broadway, to the mezzanine of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LesNocesDuFigaro" target="_blank">Les Noces du Figaro</a>, which was recently opened by the family behind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.figarobistrot.com/">Figaro Bistro</a>&nbsp;in Los Feliz. This handsome space was formerly&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/historylosangeles/schaber-s-cafeteria" target="_blank">Schaber&#8217;s Cafeteria</a>&nbsp;(Charles F. Plummer, 1928), and the mezzanine features wonderful views of the&nbsp;<a href="https://cinematreasures.org/theaters/5" target="_blank">Los Angeles Theatre</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">On the last Sunday of each month, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles (noon-2pm), for a structured Salon featuring formal presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.  If you&#8217;re interested in joining LAVA as a creative contributor or an attendee, we recommend Salon attendance as an introduction to this growing community. We also recommend the eclairs.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Presentation One: Jean Harlow Part 2</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The name resonates. Blonde Bombshell. Platinum Blonde. The labels applied by press agents during Jean Harlow&#8217;s seven-year career still carry a charge seventy years later. Harlow created the mold: the first blonde sex symbol who captured the attention of a nation, then touched their hearts with her genuine warmth and candor. At a time when Harlow&#8217;s star shone its brightest, Los Angeles and the movies gave birth to a district that exists as much in the mind as on the map. Hollywood historian Darrell Rooney is co-author of <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1883318963" target="_blank">Harlow In Hollywood</a>. </em><em>H</em>e returns to the LAVA Sunday Salon to pick up where he left off at his <a href="/salon-rooney-january2014" target="_blank">January 2014 presentation</a>, with Jean Harlow&#8217;s story following the mysterious death of her husband Paul Bern.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Presentation Two: Preserving the Legacy of Wurdman &amp; Beckett&#8217;s Animal Hospital in West Hollywood</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">West Hollywood residents and area historians Kate Eggert and Krisy Gosney of <a href="https://deadhistoryproject.com/" target="_blank">Dead History Project</a> fell into historic preservation activism when two 110-year-old bungalows on their street were threatened with demolition. Everyone said they wouldnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t win&#8230; until they did.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">Recently, they went to a West Hollywood Historic Preservation Commission meeting on a whim. The Commission discussed a </span>1938 Wurdeman &amp; Becket streamline moderne<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;animal hospital and a 1959 Barry Berkus mid-century modern office building, both slated for demolition and the site for redevelopment. They were told these buildings were a lost cause. But as a little research revealed the significance of the site, they knew they would fight. Their grassroots&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/savetheSMBstreamlinemoderne" target="_blank">preservation campaign</a> has garnered significant media attention and the support of the Los Angeles Conservancy, Art Deco Society, the family of architect Welton Becket and hundreds of passionate citizens. Responding to the rising community outcry, the developer has begun suggesting ways in which the Wurdeman &amp; Beckett structure can be integrated into a modern building.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">This LAVA presentation is about the process through which Kate and Krisy are tackling the biggest preservation fight of their careers, the highs and lows, and the delicate dance of politics, ego, money and information that impacts any community when developers seek to build on an historic site.</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Geneva, Webdings, sans-serif; font-size: 14.44444465637207px; font-style: normal; line-height: 23.654399871826172px;">The Crown City masquerades as a calm and refined retreat, where well-bred ladies glide around their perfect bungalows and everyone knows what fork to use first. But don&#8217;t be fooled by appearances. Dip into the confidential files of old Pasadena and meet assassins and oddballs, kidnappers and slashers, Satanists and all manner of maniac in a delightful little tour you WON&#8217;T find recommended by the better class of people! From celebrated cases like the RFK assassination (with a visit to Sirhan Sirhan&#8217;s folks&#8217; house), &#8220;Eraserhead&#8221; star Jack Nance&#8217;s strange end, black magician/rocket scientist Jack Parsons&#8217; death-by-misadventure and the 1926 Rose Parade grand stand collapse, to fascinating obscurities, the tour&#8217;s dozens of murders, arsons, kidnappings, robberies, suicides, auto wrecks and oddball happening sites provide a alternate history of Pasadena that&#8217;s as fascinating as it is creepy. Passengers will tour the old Millionaire&#8217;s Row on Orange Grove, thrill to the shocking Sphinx Murder on the steps of the downtown Masonic Hall and discover why people named Judd should think twice before moving to Pasadena.</span></p>
