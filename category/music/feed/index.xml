Punks and smackdowns with L.A. Police.

Before departing for points rural, Tom left his mark all over L.A., from Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s Zoetrope Studios to Sunset Sound to Skid Row. We&#8217;ll show you where Tom found his true love and collaborator, Kathleen Brennan, and how all the pieces came together to transform a drunken, desperate singer into the multi-faceted, multi-media artist he&#8217;d become.</p>

While scoring the music to Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s &#8220;One From The Heart,&#8221; he met Kathleen Brennan, whose influence would completely transform his life and his art. After a whirlwind courtship the pair married and began a 28-year creative and personal partnership, beginning with the revolutionary album &#8220;Swordfishtrombones,&#8221; the subject of tour host David Smay&#8217;s recent book.</p>

A professional photographer, he left behind a collection of nearly 30,000 images of music legends spanning two decades. His photo collection is now overseen by Jeff Schwartz and Chuckâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s siblings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Rrose in a Prose, L.A.â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s most ramshackle monthly literary salon, is pleased to announce that this monthâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s event will be something very special: a curated reading onstage at the 2014 L.A. Zine Fest!</p>
<p>Founded by music journalist and editor D. M. Collins (L.A. RECORD) in 2012 out of a sense of desperation, A Rrose in a Prose is a cure for the boring open-mic readings and pushy poetry slams you may have suffered through at coffee shops throughout the Southland. Featuring writers from all genres, and we mean all of â€˜emâ€”poets, fiction writers, essayists, eroticists, educators, rappers, playwrights, political pundits, bards, braggarts, addicts, comedians, conspirators, and critics, to name a fewâ€”and from all walks of life, A Rrose in a Proseâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s hand-picked, cross-pollinated, round-robin style readings are never dull, never safe, and might just help you find your next literary crush.</p>
<p>This month, of course, the theme is zines. And so for the first time, weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll be bringing David Markey (We Got Power! Films), Kim Cooper (Esotouric Bus Adventures, LAVA, <a href="https://www.scrammagazine.com/" target="_blank"><em>Scram Magazine</em></a>), Allison Wolfe (LadyFest, Bratmobile), and Gene Sculatti (<em>Rolling Stone, Billboard</em>) together to read some of the pivotal early works that helped them mold themselves into the artists, pundits, and smarty-pants theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve since become. We&#8217;re certain their stories, and of course their writings, will provide some laughter, some learning, and a sense of legacy for the crowd at Zine Fest.</p>
<p>Now in its third year, L.A. Zine Fest is an annual gathering of zine makers, DIY publishers, graphic novelists and readers, the kind of festival that hits that sweet spot between â€œconventionâ€ and â€œcommunity.â€ This year, itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s all coming coming together at Helmâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Bakery in Culver City, where over 175 exhibitors of zines and indie publications are scheduled to spread small press goodies across countless booths and blankets and tables for your perusal (and purchase)!</p>
<p>Thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll also be a whole dayâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s worth of presentations, readings, and events; Doors open at 10am, A Rrose in a Prose hits the main stage from 4:15 to 5 p.m.</p>
