<p>Visionary Professor Donald Johnson, in association with LAVA and Esotouric, invites you to participate in a special four-hour event at LA&#8217;s regional crime laboratory, on the campus of Cal State LA. Space is very limited and pre-reservation required for this unprecedented opportunity to tour the crime lab, learn from working forensic investigators and educators, and discover the real art and science of crime scene investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arson Murders and Fire Death Investigation&#8221; is&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal;">is hosted by Ed Nordskog, an active arson/bomb detective with the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#8217;s Department, and is&nbsp;</span>a half-day exploration of the scientific investigation of fire-related felony offenses, revealed through methods of evidence analysis, profiling and select case histories. Attendees will also have an opportunity to tour Cal State LA&#8217;s state-of the-art teaching and research facilities in the Criminalistics Department of the Hertzberg-Davis Forensic Science Center.</p>
<p>This program will explore the extraordinary challenges of dealing with fire death investigations. The destructive effects of fire and fire department suppression operations greatly skew an already complicated death scene. In addition to an in-depth a discussion of the <a href="https://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/10/local/me-1982" target="_blank">Sandi Nieves</a> case (Santa Clarity resident convicted of asphyxiating her four daughters in their home in 1998, then staging a fire to obscure her crime), the program includes discussion of body dumps and staged suicides involving fire.</p>
<p>Please note that the presentation includes extremely graphic crime scene photos, and is not for the faint of heart. No children will be admitted.</p>

<p>Visionary Professor Donald Johnson, in association with LAVA, Esotouric and the California Forensic Science Institute, invites you to participate in a special four-hour event at LAâ€™s regional crime laboratory, on the campus of Cal State LA. Space is very limited and pre-reservation required for this rare opportunity to visit the Cal State LA School of Criminal Justice and Criminalistics at the Hertzberg-Davis Forensic Science Center. Learn from working forensic investigators, true crime authors, and educators.&nbsp; Discover the real art and science of crime investigation.</p>
<p>Join acclaimed true crime author John Leake and trace evidence expert Lynne Herold, Senior Criminalist with the Los Angeles Sheriffâ€™s Department, for this special presentation based on Johnâ€™s latest book <a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1467975915">Cold A Long Time: An Alpine Mystery</a>, winner of the 2012 Independent Publisher Awardâ€”Bronze Medal, True Crime.</p>
<p><strong>The Mystery</strong>:<br /> In August 1989, Duncan MacPherson, a pro hockey player, disappeared in Europe. With no help from the police, his parents searched the Alps looking for him. They found his car near the gondola station at the Stubai Glacier, a popular ski resort near Innsbruck, Austria.  The car had sat in the lot for six weeks without being reported. Fourteen years later, Duncanâ€™s body was found at the resort.</p>
<p>What happened to Duncan MacPherson? In order to answer that question, true crime author John Leake sought the expertise of trace evidence examiner Lynne Herold, whom he knew had served as a key witness in the prosecution of international serial killer Jack Unterweger, the subject of Johnâ€™s <a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0425228010" target="_blank">first book</a>.</p>
<p>Join John and Lynne as they team up a second time to solve the 22-year-old forensic mystery of Duncan MacPhersonâ€™s disappearance. Through presentation of physical evidence recovered from the scene, eyewitness testimony, chronology of events, additional evidentiary research and peculiar gaps in the forensic records, crime lab attendees will follow John through the steps by which he discovered a shocking cover up and the answers for which Duncan MacPhersonâ€™s parents had been searching for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Also featured at this special crime lab seminar is a discussion of John Leakeâ€™s first book, <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0425228010" target="_blank">Entering Hades: The Double Life of a Serial Killer</a>,</em> about the Austrian criminal Jack Unterweger.  Discover how Unterweger expanded his murderous activities from Europe to Los Angeles and put himself squarely in the crosshairs of trace evidence expert Lynne Herold. Of her testimony at Unterwegerâ€™s Austrian trial, his attorney stated â€[she] was the most impressive expert witness. When she started talking about the ligatures, I could see the jury looking at Unterweger in a darker light, and I knew then that we were in big trouble.â€ Join us as John and Lynne discuss the ligature evidence from Jack Unterwegerâ€™s last trial, and how an international team of forensic scientists finally put an end to a deadly career.</p>
<p><strong>Biographies</strong>:</p>
<p>Born in Dallas, Texas, JOHN LEAKE went to Vienna, Austria on a graduate school scholarship and ended up living in the city for over a decade, working as a freelance writer and translator.  His first book, <em>Entering Hades: The Double Life of a Serial Killer</em>&nbsp;was a <em>New York Times</em> Sunday Book Review â€œEditorsâ€™ Choice,â€ a <em>Menâ€™s Vogue</em> â€œBest Book of 2007,â€ and the inspiration of <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/B003F0ZO6M" target="_blank">The Infernal Comedy</a></em>, starring John Malkovich.</p>
<p>LYNNE HEROLD, Ph.D., is a Senior Criminalist in the Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€™s Departmentâ€™s Scientific Services Bureau. She received her B.S. in Biological Sciences from Kent State University in 1974, and her Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from the University of Southern California in 1984. Dr. Herold has been involved in the analysis of trace evidence and testimony several â€œhigh profileâ€ cases, as well as scores of murders, serial murders, rapes and child abuse cases over the past 30 years.

<p>Visionary Professor Donald Johnson, in association with LAVA and Esotouric, invites you to participate in a special four-hour event at LAâ€™s regional crime laboratory, on the campus of Cal State LA. Space is very limited and pre-reservation required for this unprecedented opportunity to tour the crime lab, learn from working forensic investigators and educators, and discover the real art and science of crime scene investigation.</p>
<p><em>The Killer Behind The Camera</em>&nbsp;focuses on two criminal cases in which sexual offenders used the role of professional photographer in order to gain the trust of hired models, who they then murdered. These strikingly similar cases happened four decades apart, and illustrate the evolution in police work and forensic science from the 1950s through the 1990.</p>
<p>Lecture #1:  Linda Sobek, a swimsuit model and former Los Angeles Raiders cheerleader, was murdered in 1995 by photographer Charles Rathbun, who lured her to a remote dry lake bed in the Mojave Desert to shoot photos with a new Lexus SUV. Her body was dumped in the Angeles National Forest, north of Los Angeles. Rathburn lead deputies to the body after confessing he had accidentally struck Sobek while trying to teach her a car stunt on the lake bed; in fact, she was asphyxiated.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal;">Heidi Robbins, the&nbsp;</span>Assistant Director of the Scientific Services Bureau crime lab of the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#8217;s Department, and the lead investigator on the case, will outline the forensic investigation which debunked Rathbun&#8217;s testimony and the faked photos offered up as evidence of consensual sex in Rathbun&#8217;s defense. Charles Rathbun was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in 1996.</p>
<p>Lecture #2:  Harvey Glatman was a serial killer who was active in Southern California and Colorado in the late 1950s. Obsessed with the posed crime scene photographs illustrating pulp magazines, Glatman posed as a professional photographer in order to lure models into posing for scenes illustrating his murderous fantasies. Glatman photographed his victims while assaulting them, then strangled and dumped their bodies in the desert. Mike Fratantoni, an LASD Deputy who sits on the board of the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#8217;s Museum, will talk about Glatman&#8217;s crimes and his extraordinary capture, which took place after the model who could have been his last victim overpowered and beat her assailant on the side of the highway. Harvey Glatman was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and executed in 1959.</p>
<p>Between the case history lectures, the hands-on lab section will focus on methods of forensic photography and analysis.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal;">By the afternoonâ€™s conclusion, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the real work thatâ€™s done in the field by forensic investigators, and the tools and techniques used to interpret crime scenes for the benefit of investigating officers and juries.</span></p>

<p>â€œInside the Mind of the Arsonistâ€ is an exploration of the scientific investigation of fire-related felony offenses, revealed through methods of evidence analysis, profiling and select case histories. Attendees will also have an opportunity to tour Cal State LAâ€™s state-of the-art teaching and research facilities in the Criminalistics Department of the Hertzberg-Davis Forensic Science Center.</p>
<p>â€œInside the Mind of the Arsonistâ€ is hosted by Ed Nordskog, an active arson/bomb detective with the Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€™s Department and author of the new book <a href="https://www.torcheredminds.com/">â€˜Torcheredâ€™ Minds: Case Histories of Notorious Serial Arsonists.</a> Copies of Mr. Nordskogâ€™s book will be available for sale at this event, or you can purchase a copy from Amazon at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/146537552X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bubble1-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=146537552X">this link.</a><img loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=bubble1-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=146537552X" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></p>
<p>The presentation consists of two lectures from Ed Nordskog, with a related breakout scientific workshop offering illustration of the concepts raised by the lectures.</p>
<p>LECTURE #1 is an introduction to the six main motives behind the crime of arson â€“ spite/revenge, financial gain, crime concealment, excitement/recognition (hero fires), extremism, juvenile fires (curiosity/experimentation/vandalism)â€”and to Ed Nordskogâ€™s investigative specialty, a modification of the standard arson investigation in which he â€œprofilesâ€ the arson scene in order to determine a â€œmotiveâ€ for the crime. He does this by determining the actual â€œtargetâ€ of the arson attack and the method of ignition for the event. This usually indicates a motive and the level of sophistication of the offender. Because arson is a very personal crime in which the victim nearly always knows who set the fire, it is relatively easy to identify a suspectâ€”although proving they were involved is not so easy.</p>
<p>LECTURE #2 focuses on select cases studies of convicted serial arsonists, including nationally known crimes and cases on which Ed Nordskog worked personally. Included will be discussion of Glendale arson investigator / arsonist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Leonard_Orr">John Orr</a> and the prolific Washington D.C. arsonist <a href="https://www.alternet.org/story/53378/?page=entire">Thomas Sweatt</a>.</p>
<p>Following this second lecture, attendees will have the opportunity to purchase copies of Ed Nordskogâ€™s book â€â€™Torcheredâ€™ Minds: Case Histories of Notorious Serial Arsonists.â€</p>
<p>By the afternoonâ€™s conclusion, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the real work thatâ€™s done in the field by arson investigators, and the tools and techniques used to interpret crime scenes for the benefit of investigating officers and juries.</p>

<p>Visionary Professor Donald Johnson, in association with LAVA and Esotouric, invites you to participate in a special four-hour event at LAâ€™s regional crime laboratory, on the campus of Cal State LA. Space is very limited and pre-reservation required for this unprecedented opportunity to tour the crime lab, learn from working forensic investigators and educators, and discover the real art and science of crime scene investigation.</p>
<p>â€œDeep Identifications: Using National Evidence Databases To Solve Local Crimesâ€ is an exploration of the scientific investigation of violent death, revealed through methods of database-driven evidence analysis and select case histories. Attendees will also have an opportunity to tour Cal State LAâ€™s state-of the-art teaching and research facilities in the Criminalistics Department of the Hertzberg-Davis Forensic Science Center.</p>
<p>â€œDeep Identifications: Using National Evidence Databases To Solve Local Crimesâ€ consists of one crime investigation lecture by LASD Criminalist Dale Falicon, a two-part crime investigation lecture by LASD DNA Tech Lead/CODIS Administrator Steve Renteria, and related breakout scientific workshops offering illustration of the concepts raised by Mr. Faliconâ€™s investigations.</p>
<p>LECTURE #1 is Dale Faliconâ€™s presentation on his role in a fascinating â€œcold caseâ€ investigation, the 2003 closure of a 1957 double homicide, resulting from the arrest and conviction of Gerald Mason. Mason, a transient, kidnapped four teenagers in Hawthorne, stripped them, raped one and stole their car. Pulled over about 1:30am at Rosecrans and Sepulveda for a routine traffic stop by El Segundo PD officers Richard Phillips and Milton Curtis, Mason shot and killed both men. Mason fled the scene and a 48-hour manhunt followed. No substantial leads were found, and the case remained cold until September 2002, when a deathbed confession (soon proved false) renewed El Segundoâ€™s interest in the investigation. ESPD asked the LASD to re-examine the existing evidence in the hope that new clues would be discovered. Investigators turned to the evidence collected at the scene to see if modern crime investigation techniques could do something that was impossible at the time of the murders. Daleâ€™s work with a composite fingerprint taken from two partial fingerprints resulted in a positive match against the recently introduced â€œIAFIS (Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System)â€, and the name of a convicted felon: Gerald Mason. Tracked down in Columbia, South Carolina, Mason confessed to the crime and was imprisoned for two life terms. He had been a&nbsp;law-abiding citizen in decades since the crime, and was a wealthy retiree respected in his community.</p>
<p>LECTURE #2 is Steve Renteriaâ€™s presentation on his use of DNA evidence in two remarkable murder cases, and the provocative questions that were raised. Case #1 is the Phil Spector / Lana Clarkson murder investigation. Questions raised include: should DNA technology be used to answer questions which are not actually an issue in a specific crime scene purely to counter the impact of â€œThe CSI Effectâ€ on the jury? When should common sense take precedence over what the professionals think the jury needs to hear? Case #2 concerns the death of â€œChristina,â€ a woman kidnapped from an ATM and killed by her captors. Questions raised include: should crime labs apply an assembly-line approach for all cases in order to maximize numbers of samples tested? Why does each case and each item of evidence need special attention in order to get the most information possible?</p>
<p>By the afternoonâ€™s conclusion, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the real work thatâ€™s done in the field by criminalists, and the tools and techniques used to interpret crime scenes for the benefit of investigating officers and juries. Come discover the reality, so different from and so much more interesting than, what youâ€™ve seen on TV.</p>

<p>Visionary Professor Donald Johnson, in association with LAVA and Esotouric, invites you to participate in a special four-hour event at LAâ€™s regional crime laboratory, on the campus of Cal State LA. Space is very limited and pre-reservation required for this unprecedented opportunity to tour the crime lab, learn from working forensic investigators and educators, and discover the real art and science of crime scene investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cracking the Case: Patrick Tillman /&nbsp;Industry Hills Sheraton&#8221; is an exploration of the scientific investigation of equivocal violent death, revealed through methods of evidence analysis and select case histories. Attendees will also have an opportunity to tour Cal State LAâ€™s state-of the-art teaching and research facilities in the Criminalistics Department of the Hertzberg-Davis Forensic Science Center.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Cracking The Case&#8221; consists of one crime investigation lecture by Forensic Firearm and Toolmark Examiner Michael I. Kelley, one crime investigation lecture by Professor Donald Johnson, and related breakout scientific workshops offering illustration of the concepts raised by both investigations.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">LECTURE #1 is Michael I. Kelley&#8217;s presentation on his investigation of the 2004 death of Army Ranger Patrick Tillman in Afghanistan. Mr. Kelley an Adjunct Professor with the Forensic Science Department, California State University â€“ Los Angeles and a Firearm and Toolmark Examiner with the Scientific Investigation Division of the Los Angeles Police Department.</p>
<p class="p1">Patrick Tillman was an American football player who left his professional sports career and enlisted in the United States Army in May 2002. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Tillman proudly put his NFL career with the Arizona Cardinals on hold to serve his country. He and his brother Kevin joined the U.S. Army in July 2002, committing to a three-year term, volunteering for Airborne (paratrooper) and Ranger training, plus volunteering for assignment to a Ranger Unit, the 2nd battalion of the 75th Ranger Regiment in Fort Lewis, Washington. The Tillman brothers served tours in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 and in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom in 2004.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">On April 22, 2004, Patrick Tillman was killed in action. Because initial investigations into the circumstances of his death had alleged inadequacies, the United States Congress and the Commander in Chief ordered the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command to conduct the investigation. In Spring 2006, Michael I. Kelley was selected as the team leader for the Armyâ€™s crime scene reconstruction investigation of the death incident of Corporal Tillman. Mr. Kelley planned the on-site actions for the scene reconstruction and proceed to the Afghanistan village of Tit located in the Khowst Province of Afghanistan near the Pakistan/Afghanistan border under the security of the US Army Infantry, where he conducted the reconstruction of the shooting incident two years to the hour from the date of Tillman&#8217;s death. Mr. Kelleyâ€™s technical expertise in firearms and crime scene reconstruction proved invaluable during the reconstruction and was the main reason for the overall success of the mission.</p>
<p class="p1">It was determined that Ranger Corporal Patrick Tillman died as a result of friendly fire while his unit was engaged in combat with enemy forces. Tillman&#8217;s platoon was ambushed with small arms and mortar fire at while conducting combat operations in Khowst, Afghanistan. When the Army unit was ambushed by enemy forces, part of the Ranger patrol (including Corporal Tillman) immediately responded. Tillman was shot and killed while responding to enemy fire without regard for his own safety. He focused his efforts on the elimination of enemy forces and the protection of his team members. There is an inherent degree of confusion in any firefight, particularly when a unit is ambushed, and especially under difficult light and terrain conditions which produce an environment that increases the likelihood of fratricide. The results of the investigation in no way diminish the bravery and sacrifice displayed by Corporal Tillman.</p>
<p class="p1">Mr. Kelley&#8217;s presentation on his investigation into Patrick Tillman&#8217;s death will offer fascinating insights into the little-known science of battlefield forensics and clear up many of the misconceptions that still linger from this controversial incident.</p>
<p class="p1">LECTURE #2 is Professor Donald Johnson&#8217;s presentation on his crime scene reconstruction of the 1996 Industry Hills Sheraton incident. The case involved a woman who fell or was pushed to her death from her hotel balcony. Professor Johnson&#8217;s reconstruction of her fall had great bearing on the criminal investigation.</p>
<p class="p1">In November 1996, Sandra Orellana and her married boss Robert Salazar traveled from Houston on a business trip to Los Angeles, staying the night in the Industry Hills Sheraton Hotel. They were seen behaving affectionately towards each other in the hotel bar. In the morning, Orellana&#8217;s badly battered corpse was discovered on the ground beneath her room&#8217;s balcony. Although Salazar initially denied knowing anything about her death, physical evidence indicated that he had undressed hastily in her room the night before. Salazar then changed his story, admitting he had sex with Orellana, but claiming it was consensual, and that she had accidentally fallen from the balcony and he had panicked. Professor Johnson&#8217;s crime scene reconstruction takes the facts and evidence in a complex and confusing death narrative and determines what really happened on that balcony in 1996.</p>
<p class="p1">By the afternoon-s conclusion, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the real work that&#8217;s done in the field by criminalists, and the tools and techniques used to interpret crime scenes for the benefit of investigating officers and juries. Come discover the reality, so different from and so much more interesting than, what you&#8217;ve seen on TV.</p>

				<p><em>If youâ€™d like to be contacted when other crime lab tours and lectures are scheduled, <a href="/newsletter/subscriptions" target="_blank">subscribe</a> to LAVAâ€™s occasional  Crime Lab Newsletter. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Click <a href="https://esotouric.com/crimelab-4-17-11" target="_blank">here</a> to purchase your ticket for the April 17 event. For a crime lab preview from participating criminalistics graduate students, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvHMITS3MjU&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">this video</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Visionary Professor Donald Johnson, in association with LAVA and Esotouric, invites you to participate in a special four-hour event at LAâ€™s regional crime laboratory, on the campus of Cal State LA. Space is very limited and pre-reservation required for this unprecedented opportunity to spend an afternoon in the company of Lynne Herold, Senior Criminalist with the Los Angeles Sheriff&#8217;s Department.</p>
<p class="p2">&#8220;TRACE: inside the world of Lynne Herold, Criminalist&#8221; is an exploration of the scientific investigation of major crimes, revealed through methods of trace evidence analysis and select case histories. Attendees will also have an opportunity to tour Cal State LAâ€™s state-of the-art teaching and research facilities in the Criminalistics Department of the Hertzberg-Davis Forensic Science Center.</p>
<p class="p2">&#8220;TRACE&#8221; consists of three lectures by Lynne Herold and three breakout scientific workshops presented by Criminalistics graduate students.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">Lecture #1 is Lynne Herold&#8217;s personal introduction to her life and work, entitled &#8220;My World and Welcome To It.&#8221; Lecture #2 explores the use of blood stain patterns in the analysis of complex crime scenes (and one or more lucky raffle winners will get the chance to create their own blood stain patterns the way the pros do, by beating a blood-soaked sponge with a baseball bat).&nbsp;Lecture #3 is a case history of the Phil Spector /Lana Clarkson murder investigation, for which Lynne Herold did the trace evidence analyses which resulted in Spector&#8217;s conviction in his second murder trial.</p>
<p class="p2">The scientific workshop topics include blood spatter re-creation and analysis, the magic of Mylar and static electricity, and insights into hair/fiber analysis.</p>
<p class="p2">By the programâ€™s conclusion, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the real work that&#8217;s done by a senior LASD criminalist, and the tools and techniques used to interpret crime scenes for the benefit of investigating officers and juries. Come discover the reality, so different from and so much more interesting than, what you&#8217;ve seen on TV.</p>
<p class="p2">BIOGRAPHY: Dr. Lynne Herold, Ph.D. is a Senior Criminalist in the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#8217;s Department&#8217;s Scientific Services Bureau. She received her B.S. in Biological Sciences from Kent State University in 1974, and her Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from USC in 1984. Over the past two decades, Dr. Herold has been involved in hundreds of &#8220;high profile&#8221; cases, and has been instrumental in the successful prosecution of scores of murder and serial murder cases. In 2003, Dr. Herold was assigned to the murder of actress Lana Clarkson, whose name has been largely overshadowed by the celebrity status of her accused killer, record producer Phil Spector. Dr. Herold devoted in excess of 1000 hours of work to the case, which went to trial in 2007. Dr. Herold&#8217;s examination of the physical evidence in this case was technical, detailed, exhaustive and her conclusions compelling. Additionally, she was able to advise prosecutors as to areas in which the testimony of &#8220;hired gun&#8221; defense experts Dr. Henry Lee and Dr. Michael Baden could be impeached. Dr. Herold&#8217;s testimony, which lasted for five days before the eyes of the world via live television, was a textbook illustration of effective courtroom preparation and presentation. Although the 2007 trial ended in a mistrial (10 to 2 for guilt), jurors who were interviewed stated that her testimony was so well presented, they completely discounted the testimony of defense experts. In his second trial in 2009, Phil Spector was convicted of the murder of Lana Clarkson and sentenced to 19 years to life. In 2008, Dr. Herold was honored as the California Homicide Investigators&#8217; Association Support Person of the Year.</p>
<p class="p2">A portion of the proceeds from this event supports the research of Criminalistics graduate students at Cal State Los Angeles.</p>
<p class="p2">Please note that NO PHOTOGRAPHS OR VIDEOTAPING of the presentation will be permitted, and cell phones must be stowed away. The material presented is graphic and intense. No children will be admitted.</p>

<p>Visionary Professor Donald Johnson, in association with LAVA and <a href="https://esotouric.com/">Esotouric</a>, invites you to participate in a special four-hour event at LAâ€™s regional crime laboratory, on the campus of Cal State LA. Space is very limited and pre-reservation required for this unprecedented opportunity to tour the crime lab, learn from working forensic investigators and educators, and discover the real art and science of crime scene investigation.</p>
<p>â€œThe Science and Art of Forensic Investigations: Criminalistics from Test Tube to Testimonyâ€ provides an insiderâ€™s view of the scientific investigation of crime, as  Criminalistics faculty and graduate students share their knowledge and insight on the theory and practice of forensic science in our criminal justice system.  Attendees will also tour Cal State LAâ€™s state-of the-art teaching and research facilities at the Hertzberg-Davis Forensic Science Center.</p>
<p>The afternoon begins with an introduction to the field of Criminalistics and the use of physical evidence in criminal investigations, hosted by Professor Donald Johnson, followed by an overview of the academic and research programs in Criminalistics at Cal State LA.</p>
<p>Then, attendees will be provided with additional insight on forensic methods during breakout sessions on Crime Scene Investigation, Forensic Chemistry, and Forensic Biology.  The CSI session, hosted by Donald Johnson and Katherine Scriven, highlights tools used by forensic specialists in the field and emerging technologies in CSI.  The Forensic Chemistry session, hosted by Isaac Cheney, surveys methods used for the analysis of trace evidence and controlled substances, and current research will be presented on the development of methods to detect narcotic-tampering by health professionals.  The Forensic Biology session, hosted by Kristin Honig and Stacy Wilkinson, highlights body fluid and DNA analysis, with a presentation on current research on methods to improve the recovery of semen in rape cases.</p>
<p>The afternoon concludes with a true life&#8211;and very graphic, viewer discretion is advised&#8211;investigation overview regarding the murder of a family in Los Angeles County and opportunities to ask questions.  By the programâ€™s conclusion, attendees will have a basic understanding of the strengths and limitations of forensic methods used in criminal investigations, and a fresh perspective on the real art and science that takes place behind the scenes and the headlines.</p>
<p>A portion of the proceeds from this event supports the research of Criminalistics graduate students at Cal State Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The afternoon begins with an introduction to the field of Criminalistics and the use of physical evidence in criminal investigations, hosted by Professor Donald Johnson, followed by an overview of the academic and research programs in Criminalistics at Cal State LA.</p>
<p>Then, attendees will be provided with additional insight on forensic methods during breakout sessions on Crime Scene Investigation, Forensic Chemistry, and Forensic Biology.  The CSI session, hosted by Donald Johnson and Katherine Scriven, highlights tools used by forensic specialists in the field and emerging technologies in CSI.  The Forensic Chemistry session, hosted by Isaac Cheney, surveys methods used for the analysis of trace evidence and controlled substances, and current research will be presented on the development of methods to detect narcotic-tampering by health professionals.  The Forensic Biology session, hosted by Kristin Honig and Stacy Wilkinson, highlights body fluid and DNA analysis, with a presentation on current research on methods to improve the recovery of semen in rape cases.</p>
<p>The afternoon concludes with a true life&#8211;and very graphic, viewer  discretion is advised&#8211;investigation overview regarding the murder of a  family in Los Angeles County and opportunities to ask questions.  By the  programâ€™s conclusion, attendees will have a basic understanding of the  strengths and limitations of forensic methods used in criminal  investigations, and a fresh perspective on the real art and science that  takes place behind the scenes and the headlines.</p>
<p>A portion of the proceeds from this event supports the research of Criminalistics graduate students at Cal State Los Angeles.</p>
