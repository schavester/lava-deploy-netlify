<h3>The Photography of Kristin Bedford: Race, History &amp; the Divine</h3>
<p>Los Angeles-based photographer Kristin Bedford will be presenting her series of photographs about the legacy of the African-American religious leader Father Divine. The body of work delves into issues of race, American religious history, and the mystery of enduring faith.</p>
<p>Father Divine, known to his followers as God, once had tens of thousands of devotees in 1930s Harlem. To the outside world Father Divine died in 1965, but for his followers he â€œlay his body downâ€ and is still with them as he always has been. Now in their seventies, eighties, and nineties, eighteen of the remaining celibate followers live with Mother Divine at Fatherâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s estate outside of Philadelphia. In 2013, Kristin Bedford spent five weeks living with and photographing this community.</p>
<p>The followers, who call themselves â€œThe International Peace Mission Movement,â€ are living a way of life and performing rituals created over eighty years ago by their God. With the lack of new followers, their movement is likely in its final chapter. Bedford had the chance to experience and photograph their traditions before they fade away.</p>
<p>The Father Divine presentation will be followed by an exclusive sneak peek of Bedfordâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s current photography project.</p>
<h4>Biography</h4>
<p>Kristin Bedford is a Los Angeles-based photographer who focuses on long-term visual studies of where we live â€“ the streets we walk down, the places we worship in, the homes we create, and the spaces between them all. Her subjects have included religious movements, street culture in numerous urban centers, and the modern day legacy of historic African-American communities.</p>

<p>Join poet and memoirist Joan Jobe Smith for an afternoon of poetry &amp; storytelling at the <span class="caps">LAVA</span> Sunday Salon. The newly published <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1502898284" target="_blank">Tales of An Ancient Go-Go Girl</a></em> by long-time Long Beach, California resident Joan Jobe Smith, is a picaresque True Tale, a 50-year Glotessey spanning the 1965 Los Angeles Watts Riots, near death at the hands of a homicidal ex-husband, the counter-culture go-go swinging let-it-all-hang-out 1960s-â€˜70s, single Motherhood and Feminism. Rarely does a natural poet and historian such as Joan Jobe Smith endure such ordeals and challenges and survive to tell the tale. It is a Tale written with go-going panache and patois, and heart, courage and humor to make our lives richer and wiser. The event will be a series of short Q&amp;As with LAVA&#8217;s Richard Schave on milestones from the memoir, punctuated by Joan reading poetry selections which span her career.</p>
<p>Excerpts from 5-Star Reviews of <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1502898284" target="_blank">Tales of An Ancient Go-Go Girl</a></em>:</p>
<p>â€œCharles Bukowski said the inimitable Joan Jobe Smithâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s writing â€˜has the reality of force properly put down on paper; she cuts herself loose into the stratosphere.â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Joanâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s heart is so damned big. Sheâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s not only cut herself loose into the stratosphere, she takes anyone who wants to go with her along for the ride. And now we have this raw-edged, honest, beauty of a bookâ€¦â€ â€”L. Jakiela, Creative Writing Professor, University of Pittsburgh</p>
<p>â€œVividly conjures up the dark shadows and wisecracks of a Film Noir, set in 1960s-â€˜70s L.A., with a cast of glamourous yet vulnerable dancers, slimy bosses, wharf rats (both rodents, ex-husband and customers) with walk-ons by celebrities (Dick Dale, Ike and Tina Turner) amongst the burgeoning pop music and drug counter-culture of the era. Energized by Joan Jobe Smithâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s poetic eye and exuberant syntax, these true Tales will enthrall readers, revealing its author as a brilliant chronicler of her Noir-ish life and times.â€œâ€”Jules Smith, Londonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s <em>Times Literary Supplement</em></p>
<p>â€œI just finished reading Joan Jobe Smithâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s <em><span class="caps">Tales of An Ancient Go-Go Girl</span>.</em> She has such a descriptive, poetic talent for words as she weaves her true life tales of love, jealousy, near murder and trials. Bukowski advised her to write about her go-go girl years. I admire her ability to bring scenes from the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s so vividly to life.â€&#8211;Linda King</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>An important message from LAVA &#8211; September 9, 2014</strong></p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>It is with no small amount of regret that we are putting the monthly LAVA Sunday Salon and Broadway on My Mind walking tour series on hiatus, effective immediately. Both events take place at Les Noces du Figaro restaurant, which is closing down for several months of renovations.</p>
<p>We will be working closely with Jonathan Mgaieth of Figaro to determine a relaunch date as soon as the restaurant reopens, hopefully in early 2015. So stay tuned, and we hope to see you at other LAVA events in the meantime.</p>
<p>Please know that your continued thoughts and good will are the rock upon which LAVA builds its house.</p>
<p>With thanks for your understanding, we remain,<br />Richard Schave and Kim Cooper<br />LAVA &#8211; The Los Angeles Visionaries Association</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Join&nbsp;<span class="caps">LAVA</span>&nbsp;for our revived free monthly Sunday Salon series. We return to South Broadway, to the mezzanine of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LesNocesDuFigaro" target="_blank">Les Noces du Figaro</a>, which was recently opened by the family behind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.figarobistrot.com/">Figaro Bistro</a>&nbsp;in Los Feliz. This handsome space was formerly&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/historylosangeles/schaber-s-cafeteria" target="_blank">Schaber&#8217;s Cafeteria</a>&nbsp;(Charles F. Plummer, 1928), and the mezzanine features wonderful views of the&nbsp;<a href="https://cinematreasures.org/theaters/5" target="_blank">Los Angeles Theatre</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">On the last Sunday of each month, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles (noon-2pm), for a structured Salon featuring formal presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.  If you&#8217;re interested in joining LAVA as a creative contributor or an attendee, we recommend Salon attendance as an introduction to this growing community. We also recommend the eclairs.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Presentation One: Jean Harlow Part 2</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The name resonates. Blonde Bombshell. Platinum Blonde. The labels applied by press agents during Jean Harlow&#8217;s seven-year career still carry a charge seventy years later. Harlow created the mold: the first blonde sex symbol who captured the attention of a nation, then touched their hearts with her genuine warmth and candor. At a time when Harlow&#8217;s star shone its brightest, Los Angeles and the movies gave birth to a district that exists as much in the mind as on the map. Hollywood historian Darrell Rooney is co-author of <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1883318963" target="_blank">Harlow In Hollywood</a>. </em><em>H</em>e returns to the LAVA Sunday Salon to pick up where he left off at his <a href="/salon-rooney-january2014" target="_blank">January 2014 presentation</a>, with Jean Harlow&#8217;s story following the mysterious death of her husband Paul Bern.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Presentation Two: Preserving the Legacy of Wurdman &amp; Beckett&#8217;s Animal Hospital in West Hollywood</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">West Hollywood residents and area historians Kate Eggert and Krisy Gosney of <a href="https://deadhistoryproject.com/" target="_blank">Dead History Project</a> fell into historic preservation activism when two 110-year-old bungalows on their street were threatened with demolition. Everyone said they wouldnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t win&#8230; until they did.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">Recently, they went to a West Hollywood Historic Preservation Commission meeting on a whim. The Commission discussed a </span>1938 Wurdeman &amp; Becket streamline moderne<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;animal hospital and a 1959 Barry Berkus mid-century modern office building, both slated for demolition and the site for redevelopment. They were told these buildings were a lost cause. But as a little research revealed the significance of the site, they knew they would fight. Their grassroots&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/savetheSMBstreamlinemoderne" target="_blank">preservation campaign</a> has garnered significant media attention and the support of the Los Angeles Conservancy, Art Deco Society, the family of architect Welton Becket and hundreds of passionate citizens. Responding to the rising community outcry, the developer has begun suggesting ways in which the Wurdeman &amp; Beckett structure can be integrated into a modern building.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">This LAVA presentation is about the process through which Kate and Krisy are tackling the biggest preservation fight of their careers, the highs and lows, and the delicate dance of politics, ego, money and information that impacts any community when developers seek to build on an historic site.</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Join&nbsp;<span class="caps">LAVA</span>&nbsp;for our revived free monthly Sunday Salon series. We return to South Broadway, to the mezzanine of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LesNocesDuFigaro" target="_blank">Les Noces du Figaro</a>, which was recently opened by the family behind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.figarobistrot.com/">Figaro Bistro</a>&nbsp;in Los Feliz. This handsome space was formerly&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/historylosangeles/schaber-s-cafeteria" target="_blank">Schaber&#8217;s Cafeteria</a>&nbsp;(Charles F. Plummer, 1928), and the mezzanine features wonderful views of the&nbsp;<a href="https://cinematreasures.org/theaters/5" target="_blank">Los Angeles Theatre</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">On the last Sunday of each month, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles (noon-2pm), for a structured Salon featuring formal presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.  If you&#8217;re interested in joining LAVA as a creative contributor or an attendee, we recommend Salon attendance as an introduction to this growing community. We also recommend the eclairs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Read about the original Sunday Salon at Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria&nbsp;<a href="/cliftonsalons" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A Note On Arriving Downtown on Sunday</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">The Made In America concert will close off the Civic Center (the area around City Hall) for the whole weekend.  Please do not, if you are driving, take the 101 freeway to come downtown, as you will be plagued with festival detours.  The Pershing Square Metro Station is the closest transit stop to Cafe Figaro. If you are driving, it is easy to access 7th &amp; Broadway if arriving via the 10 freeway, the 60 or the 5. We recommend taking public transportation, or allowing yourself more time than usual if you are driving.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation One:</strong><strong>&nbsp;Charlie Parker&#8217;s Central Avenue Jazz&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Alto saxophonist Charlie Parker arrived at Los Angeles&#8217; Union<strong> </strong>Station in December of 1945 all but tied to his seat. Somewhere in the southwestern desert his heroin withdrawals had caught up with him and the rest of the band knew they were going to be in for a long trip. But none was going to be as long as Parker&#8217;s.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">The two titans of bebop, Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, had booked a winter gig in sunny LA.  Six nights a week in a Hollywood nightclub was a nice way to get out of the City and introduce a new audience to their innovative bebop sounds &#8212; but Parker&#8217;s spiraling drug problem was a liability before the band had even packed their bags.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">When the residency finally ended, relationships were in shambles, box office receipts were disappointing and the band was eager to just get home. But Parker didn&#8217;t show up for the flight. It took him over a year to finally get out of Los Angeles. During his extended stay, Parker had disastrous recording sessions, transcendent recording sessions, he signed over royalties to his drug dealer, lit his hotel room on fire and eventually served six months in a mental institution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Author Sean J. O&#8217;Connell chronicles Los Angeles&#8217;s unique 20th century jazz scene in his newest book,&nbsp;<a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/146713130X" target="_blank"><em>Los Angeles&#8217;s Central Avenue Jazz.</em></a> For his first LAVA presentation, he will chart the journey of jazz&#8217; greatest destructive genius through the nightclubs and back alleys of 1940s Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation Two:</strong><strong> Living a Magickal Life</strong></p>
<p>What is magick and how does one live it? From kitchen witchery and crafting to ceremonial magic, join us to examine the core principles underlying magick and discover ways to enrich your life by creating change in accord with Will.</p>
<p>Soror Lilya is an Initiate of <a href="https://www.starsapphire-oto.org/" target="_blank">Ordo Templi Orientis</a>, a Thelemite and a Crafter who has been working with Magick for over 20 years.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The Salon will be followed by a free walking tour, <a href="/flaneur-broadway-on-my-mind-12" target="_blank">The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway on My Mind walking tour #12</a>.

<p><strong>Presentation One</strong> <em>The Mystique of the Orange.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Cloaked in mystery and available only to the elite until modern times, the orange has been known as the fruit of the gods, the food of emperors, a token of gratitude and a symbol of health, wealth and love. Since it entered history, the dream of California has been that it is a place of plenty, of potential, of personal opportunity. The orange became a glowing symbol of this dream. <a title="David Boule" href="https://www.angelcitypress.com/collections/authors-david-boule" target="_blank">David BoulÃ©</a>, author of the recently released <a title="Orange &amp; the California Dream" href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1883318629" target="_blank"><em>The Orange and the Dream of California</em></a> (Angel City Press), will take a lively, literary and extraordinarily visual look at this colorful and captivating history and reveal the tremendous impact of the orange on the culture and development of California, and how these two entities have built on one another to feed the imagination and conjure a compelling fantasy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">A third generation Californian, David has a lifelong fascination with the history, culture, achievements and uniqueness of the region. â€œThe enduring image of California as paradise and the orange as unique among all fruit is because, partially, these things are true. These traits have then been magnified by poets and boosters, artists and hucksters, songwriters and bureaucrats<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal;">â€”</span>with both artistic and commercial motivation<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal;">â€”</span>to appeal to peopleâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s continuing desire to believe that such exceptional perfection can really exist,â€ he says.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation Two</strong> <em>Charlie Chaplin &amp; Keystoneâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Centennial.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">One hundred years ago, Charlie Chaplin made his film debut in Mack Sennettâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Keystone Comedies. Within the year, he would become the biggest star in motion pictures, going on to set filmmaking artistic standards that some feel have never be duplicated. During that first year of 1914, Chaplin filmed in various Los Angeles neighborhoods, andâ€”in several casesâ€”used actual events (ranging from the dedication of a Wilmington wharf to various auto races on streets and tracks) as a backdrop for his comedies. <a title="Brent's Senett Blog" href="https://macksennett.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Brent E. Walker</a>, author of <a title="Mack Sennett's Fun Factory" href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0786477113" target="_blank"><em>Mack Sennettâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Fun Factory</em></a>, will take us on a guided tour of Chaplin in 1914, and the Los Angeles history revealed in these early comedies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span class="caps">PLEASE</span> <span class="caps">NOTE</span>: this Sunday Salon will be slightly longer than usual in order to accommodate three talks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">The second presentation will end at 1:45pm. The third presentation runs from 2:00pm-2:30pm, and will serve as an introduction to the <a href="/flaneur-broadway-on-my-mind-11">Broadway On My Mind Walking Tour</a> which immediately follows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><strong>Presentation Three</strong>: Open Street Map &amp; Historical Overlays</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Join us as <a href="https://www.tmcnet.com/tmcnet/Columnists/columnist.aspx?id=100125">Charlotte Wolter</a> explains how <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> is creating an open, free map of the world that anyone can use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">It works by marshaling the energies and knowledge of tens of thousands of volunteers around the globe who contribute their time and local knowledge in a phenomenon known as â€œcrowd-sourcing,â€ focusing this mass of people in a common effort for the common good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">[OpenStreetMap] is also a sophisticated technical effort, one in which some of the best minds in geographic / mapping science and computing have contributed their abilities to create the storage system that keeps all of OpenStreetMapsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> huge data files safe and quick to access.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">These programmers also have helped to develop an online mapping interface that make it easy for anyone to contribute to OpenStreetMap. If you have an interest in the history of a place, OpenStreetMap (and its corollary, <a href="https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/">OpenHistoricalMap</a>) are here to provide a way to put that history, literally, on the map.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">If youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d like to map historical sites that still exist, youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll use OpenStreetMap. For lost locations, <a href="https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/">OpenHistoricalMap</a> is the place where contributors can provide reconstructions of places that existed in the past, whether the buildings still exist today or not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">In this presentation, you will have an opportunity to try your hand at contributing to OpenStreetMap, using your knowledge of historic sites in Los Angeles. You can even bring your laptop computer if youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d like to learn how to edit Open StreetMap at home. The tools and techniques youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll discover in this presentation will also be useful if youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d like to add lost locations to <a href="https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/">OpenHistoricalMap</a> .</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The Salon will be followed by a free walking tour,&nbsp;</span><a style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;" title="The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway Master Streetscape Walking Tour #11" href="/flaneur-broadway-on-my-mind-11" target="_blank">The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway on My Mind walking tour #11</a><span style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">.

<p><strong><em>Presentation One</em>: </strong><strong>24 writers: 20th Century Science Fiction </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Milt Stevens, a long time Science Fiction fan who for a bit over fifty years has been a member of the <a href="https://www.lasfsinc.info/" target="blank">Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society</a>&nbsp;â€” the worldâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s oldest science fiction club, and which for many years met down the street at Cliftonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Cafeteria&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11.818181991577148px; font-style: normal;">â€”&nbsp;</span>will talk about 24 writers who are major influences on 20th century SF.

Some of the writers to be discussed are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Williamson" target="_blank">Jack Williamson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut" target="_blank">Kurt Vonnegut</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh_Brackett" target="_blank">Leigh Brackett</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Zimmer_Bradley" target="_blank">Marion Zimmer Bradley</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Leinster" target="_blank">Murray Leinster</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octavia_E._Butler" target="_blank">Octavia Butler</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick" target="_blank">Philip K.

<p><strong><em>Presentation Two</em>: </strong><strong>The Magical World Of Jack Parsons </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">The fascinating story of Jack Parsons â€” follower of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleister_Crowley" target="_blank">Aleister Crowley</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerojet" target="_blank">pioneering rocket scientist</a>, and early member of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Science_Fantasy_Society" target="_blank">Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society</a> â€” has become increasingly well known in recent years. But few have examined his beliefs and practices. To really understand the man who summoned the goddess Babalon into physical manifestation, you need to start with the law of Thelema, proceed through <a href="https://www.starsapphire-oto.org/" target="_blank">Ordo Templi Orientis</a>, Qabalah and Enochian magick, and continue to the reception of Liber <span class="caps">XLIX</span> and the transformation of Witchcraft for a new Aeon. Join Craig Berry, an initiate of Ordo Templi Orientis, on a journey through the magical world of Jack Parsons.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Join&nbsp;<span class="caps">LAVA</span>&nbsp;for our revived free monthly Sunday Salon series. We return to South Broadway, to the mezzanine of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LesNocesDuFigaro" target="_blank">Les Noces du Figaro</a>, which was recently opened by the family behind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.figarobistrot.com/">Figaro Bistro</a>&nbsp;in Los Feliz. This handsome space was formerly&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/historylosangeles/schaber-s-cafeteria" target="_blank">Schaberâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Cafeteria</a>&nbsp;(Charles F. Plummer, 1928), and the mezzanine features wonderful views of the&nbsp;<a href="https://cinematreasures.org/theaters/5" target="_blank">Los Angeles Theatre</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">On the last Sunday of each month, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles (noon-2pm), for a structured Salon featuring formal presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.  If youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re interested in joining LAVA as a creative contributor or an attendee, we recommend Salon attendance as an introduction to this growing community. We also recommend the eclairs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Read about the original Sunday Salon at Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria&nbsp;<a href="/cliftonsalons" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Because of the scope and scale of the program, this monthâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Sunday Salon will not follow our usual varied two-act structure, but will focus almost entirely on Electronic Music. The program will include the history of the genre, some theoretical discussion, a performance and a hands-on demonstration. We will break for about ten minutes about an hour into the presentation. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Our focus is on Electronic Music, and the sub-genre known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_bending" target="_blank">Circuit Bending</a>. Circuit Bending is the creative rewiring of pre-existing circuits to make new media. Often these circuits are found in inexpensive childrenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s toys and â€œobsoleteâ€ devices. Important aspects of Circuit Bending are the D.I.Y (Do It Yourself) autodidactic nature of immediate exploration into new electronic sounds and the ability to engage in instrument building without the need for an electrical engineering degree. The artists presenting today, <a href="https://andyben.com/music/music.html" target="_blank">Andy Ben</a>, <a href="https://circuitryandpoetry.com/aboutus/AboutUs.html" target="_blank">Jeff Boynton</a> and <a href="https://circuitryandpoetry.com/aboutus/AboutUs.html" target="_blank">Mona Jean Cedar</a>, explore the implications of Circuit Bending through a variety of contexts, including performance, documentary video and education.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">For Mona Jean Cedar (poet, dancer and sign language interpreter) and Jeff Boynton (electronic musician), â€œCircuitry and Poetryâ€ arose out of a desire to create collaborative artwork. Jeffâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s initial impulse was to create interactive electronic instruments that would respond to Monaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s hand and body movements. This did not happen immediately due to the steep learning curve of electronics, but it led to the discovery of the â€œblack artâ€ of Circuit Bending. This was the jumping off point, and eventually Jeff was able to develop interfaces that would allow Circuit Bent instruments to respond to light, sound and movement. Mona had already been creating work in which poetry and movement was composed specifically for how well they will work with sign language. Presenter Andy Ben is a musician and technologist and film maker who is interested in the digital convergence and post consumer culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">The <span class="caps">LAVA</span> Sunday Salon will also feature a short presentation by the scholar and writer <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/contributor/fanny-daubigny" target="_blank">Fanny Daubigny</a> about the American translator <a href="https://ndbooks.com/author/louise-varese" target="_blank">Louise VarÃ¨se</a> and her work with 19th century French poetry. (Louise VarÃ¨se was the wife of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgard_Var%C3%A8se" target="_blank">Edgar VarÃ¨se</a>, whose compositions are considered a cornerstone of electronic music.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">The Salon will be followed by a free walking tour,&nbsp;<a title="The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway Master Streetscape Walking Tour #9" href="/flaneur-broadway-on-my-mind-9" target="_blank">The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway on My Mind walking tour #9</a>.

<p>Join&nbsp;<span class="caps">LAVA</span>&nbsp;for our revived free monthly Sunday Salon series. We return to South Broadway, to the mezzanine of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LesNocesDuFigaro" target="_blank">Les Noces du Figaro</a>, which was recently opened by the family behind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.figarobistrot.com/">Figaro Bistro</a>&nbsp;in Los Feliz. This handsome space was formerly&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/historylosangeles/schaber-s-cafeteria" target="_blank">Schaberâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Cafeteria</a>&nbsp;(Charles F. Plummer, 1928), and the mezzanine features wonderful views of the&nbsp;<a href="https://cinematreasures.org/theaters/5" target="_blank">Los Angeles Theatre</a>.</p>
<p>On the last Sunday of each month, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles (noon-2pm), for a structured Salon featuring formal presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.  If youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re interested in joining LAVA as a creative contributor or an attendee, we recommend Salon attendance as an introduction to this growing community. We also recommend the eclairs.</p>
<p>Read about the original Sunday Salon at Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria&nbsp;<a href="/cliftonsalons" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><span>The Salon will be broken into two distinct presentations each lasting about 45 minutes. You are encouraged to arrive early if you wish to order food and beverages from the counter downstairs, and&nbsp;<span>bring your meal upstairs.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Presentation One: </strong>In celebration of <a href="https://www.poets.org/page.php/prmID/41" target="_blank">National Poetry Month</a>, <a href="https://suzannelummis.com/" target="_blank">Suzanne Lummis</a>, <a href="https://capitalandmain.com/christmas-eve-1984-motel-x/" target="_blank">Cece Peri</a> and <a href="https://daleraoul.com/" target="_blank">Dale Raoul</a> will present a series of readings in the vein of Poetry Noir. The readings will explore the themes of this genre: crime, decay, anonymity, hauntings from the past and a palpable sense of place and feel unique to Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation Two:&nbsp;</strong>Architectural historian <a href="https://www.insroland.org/user/653" target="_blank">Nathan Marsak</a>, author of <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0764315420" target="_blank">Los Angeles Neon</a></em>, will present on Los Angeles&#8217;s great public mausolea.  In this cultural and architectural history of how Los Angeles came to understand the community mausoleum, Marsak will chart the southland&#8217;s parallels with and digressions from America&#8217;s developing mores and attitudes toward the space of death.</p>
<p>Emerging from the early 20th-century Garden Cemetery movement, Los Angeles not only contributed the concept of the memorial park, but also many of the finest&#8211;and sometimes strangest&#8211;grand public mausolea known. Los Angeles, long noted for its mimetic &#8220;California Crazy&#8221; and futuristic Googie architecture, needed, in its funerary architecture, to strive for solemnity and sublimity.&nbsp; Nevertheless, its cemetery buildings betray a peculiar and genuinely Southern Californian ethos in their expression.</p>
<p>Discussed will be the 1903 Chapel of the Pines crematory and columbarium; the early community mausolea of the &#8216;teens; the interbellum wonders of Forest Lawn&#8217;s neogothic Great Mausoleum, Angeles Abbey&#8217;s Arabian wonderland, and early-Christian meets Art Deco at Calvary Cemetery. Particular study will be given to the postwar era and the specific challenges mausoleum design faced adapting to Modernism&#8211;it is during this period they are routinely disparaged as filing cabinet necro-tenements&#8211;and how new considerations of population and land management influenced the building of open garden-court mausolea and columbaria. </p>
<p>Their legacy has left us with a means to gauge the city&#8217;s development (as well as remarkable tile work and stained glass).&nbsp; Through this lens, Marsak will reveal this significant, yet little-valued aspect of our architectural landscape.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation One</strong></p>
<p>In its first century of existence, beginning in 1850, Los Angeles County government evolved from a frontier institution with only a few constituents, a meager treasury and few duties, to an early American &#8220;<em>urban county&#8221;</em> and an innovator in local government at this level. The issues faced by the countyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s leadership in the form of the Board of Supervisors had a profound effect on the economy and quality of life in what would become the most populous county in the nation. Many of these challenges, as examined in Tom Sittonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s book <a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0914421336"><em>The Courthouse Crowd: Los Angeles County and its Government, 1850-1950</em></a> would persist in the post-World War II era and are still apparent today. In his presentation, author Tom Sitton will discuss a few of these issues and some of the increasingly powerful Supervisors who faced them, share a colorful &#8220;rogues&#8217; gallery&#8221; of some of the most corrupt politicians in the region&#8217;s history, and describe how the book was written.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation Two</strong></p>
<p>A joint presentation centered around <a href="https://www.thekeptgirl.com/p/the-kept-girl.html"><em>The Kept Girl</em></a>&nbsp;(<em>Esotouric Ink, 2014)</em>, <span class="caps">LAVA</span> co-founder Kim Cooperâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s novel of 1929 Los Angeles starring the young Raymond Chandler, his devoted secretary and the real-life cop who is a likely model for Philip Marlowe. Kim will dig deep into the bookâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s true crime and literary inspirations and the process of bringing the book to press. Artist <a href="https://www.paulrogersstudio.com/">Paul Rogers</a> will discuss his cover art for <a href="https://www.thekeptgirl.com/p/the-kept-girl.html"><em>The Kept Girl</em></a>, then move into a more freeform discussion of his often historic L.A.-themed creative process, from the germ of an idea, to photos, sketches, all the way to a complete series of prints.</p>
