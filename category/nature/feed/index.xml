<p>Join us in the Cal State Los Angeles teaching crime lab for an afternoonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s inquiry into the history and practice of forensic science in Los Angeles, in support of new research coming out of the Criminalistics Department.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presentation #1: V is for Vice</p>
<p>Mike Fratantoni, an <span class="caps">LASD</span> Jailer who sits on the board of the Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Museum and is organizing the new exhibition space in the Hall of Justice, makes a return engagement with a fascinating presentation on the unwritten history of vice in West Hollywood and corruption in law enforcement.</p>
<p>In 1940, West Hollywood madam Lee Francis was arrested on a morals charge, her first. Media coverage of the subsequent trial exposed the thriving trade in sin along the Sunset Strip, and had southland husbands quaking in their socks. But the papers never printed the name of one prostitute arrested in the â€œHouse of Francisâ€ raid: LaVonne Weaver, soon-to-be wife of gang kingpin Mickey Cohen. For decades, mob historians have chased down rumors that â€œdance instructorâ€ Lavonne was actually a â€œworking girl.â€ Wonder no more, as in a <span class="caps">LAVA</span> exclusive, LaVonne Weaverâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s mugshot will be unveiled. Lee Francis had a reputation, but madam Brenda Allen was an underworld superstar, as famous for her wardrobe and high-powered social connections as she was for the services available at her hillside brothel. Her 1948 arrest and subsequent Grand Jury investigation revealed deep veins of corruption within the Los Angeles Police Department.</p>
<h3>Presentation #2: Beverly Hills Confidential</h3>
<p>Clark Fogg, the lead forensics investigator at the Beverly Hills Police Department, and investigative journalist Barbara Schroeder share the sensational crimes and scandals of the glamorous city of Beverly Hills, as chronicled in their book â€œBeverly Hills Confidential: A Century of Stars, Scandals and Murders.â€</p>
<p>Featured topics include:</p>
<p>The cityâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s first blockbuster scandal â€” the Doheny murder mystery at Greystone Mansion â€” New information on who really killed gangster Bugsy Siegel â€” The true story of the death of Lupe Velez, the movie star known as â€œThe Mexican Spitfireâ€ â€” The mysterious execution of publicist-to-the-stars Ronni Chasen</p>
<p>Copies of â€œBeverly Hills Confidentialâ€ will be available for purchase and signing during the event.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Join us in the Cal State Los Angeles teaching crime lab for an afternoonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s inquiry into the history and practice of forensic science in Los Angeles, in support of new research coming out of the Criminalistics Department.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Presentation #1</strong>: Stalking The Night Stalker</p>
<p>Almost exactly thirty years ago, Richard Ramirez was captured by a mob of enraged East Los Angeles community members, ending the reign of terror of the self-proclaimed Night Stalker, who laid siege to the city through a series of vicious home invasion attacks in the spring and summer of 1985.</p>
<p>Giselle Lavigne is a forensic investigator for the Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Department who worked on analyzing the physical evidence used for Richard Ramirezâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> murder trial. She will present in great detail on the full complement of forensic evidence that was gathered, revealing the actions of the killer through the trace, blood and other evidence he left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation #2</strong>: The 60 Freeway Slayer</p>
<p>Professor Donald Johnson, our host and the Director of the Criminalistics Department, will present on six murders of prostitutes in 1993-94, which were initially attributed to an unknown â€œ60 Freeway Slayer.â€</p>
<p>When Professor Johnson was a forensic investigator for the Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Department, he investigated the murders, and gathered the evidence which, almost a decade later with the introduction of <span class="caps">DNA</span> evidence into the courtroom, would result in the conviction and death sentence of the â€œ60 Freeway Slayer,â€ who <span class="caps">DNA</span> evidence showed to be incarcerated felon Ivan Hill. The case is a pivotal example of the remarkable impact that new forensic technology has in the courtroom and the lab.</p>
<p>By the afternoonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s conclusion, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the evolving toolkit used to gather and interpret physical evidence for the benefit of investigating officers and juries, from the 1980s to the present.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Join us in the Cal State Los Angeles teaching crime lab for an afternoonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s inquiry into the history and practice of forensic science in Los Angeles, in support of new research coming out of the Criminalistics Department.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Presentation #1:&nbsp;<em>The Secrets of Forensic Firearm Analysis</em> with Forensic Firearm and Toolmark Examiner Michael I. Kelley</p>
<p>For our first talk, join Michael I. Kelley, who works with the Los Angeles Sheriffâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Department as a trainer in the Firearm Identification unit, and who previously presented on his crime scene reconstruction of Pat Tillmanâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s death in Afghanistan, for an in-depth presentation on law enforcement techniques for analyzing projectiles and weapons from criminal investigations.</p>
<p>In this introduction to the science of forensic firearm analysis, illustrated with real crime scene photographs and casework, Mike will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Examination of ammunition.</li>
<li>Microscopic comparisons of fired bullets, cartridge cases and toolmarks.</li>
<li>Distance Determination.</li>
<li>Serial number restorations.</li>
<li>Physical fracture matches.</li>
<li>The Cross Fire (<span class="caps">IBIS</span>) System</li>
<li>Toolmark identification</li>
</ul>
<p>Presentation #2: <em>Murder Behind Bars</em> with LASD Team Leader and educator Nick Guskos</p>
<p>For our second talk, join <span class="caps">LASD</span> Team Leader and educator Nick Guskos, co-author of the 2013 textbook <a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0135057493" target="_blank">Criminal Investigation: An Illustrated Case Study Approach</a>, for an insightful presentation inside the hidden world of gang communication. Nick takes us deep within the investigation into a case of a murder which occurred inside the walls of the Los Angeles County Jail. Youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll follow along as the case unfolds and is eventually solved through intelligence gathering. Intelligence gathering is the key to understanding all complex criminal organizations, including terrorism. This latter area is the topic of Nickâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s doctoral dissertation, and will be covered at the conclusion of his talk.</p>
<p>By the afternoonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s conclusion, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the real work thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s done in the field by forensic investigators, and the tools and techniques used to interpret physical evidence and analyze intelligence for the benefit of investigating officers and juries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://restorepershingsquare.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Pershing Square Restoration Society</a> invites you to attend an announcement from Councilman Jose Huizar and the Department of Recreation and Parks about a proposed new direction for Pershing Square and the former Pershing Square Task Force.</p>
<p>In 2013, the Pershing Square Task Force was formed with the intent of &#8220;Re-Envisioning&#8221; the historic park. Public response has overwhelmingly supported a different model: the restoration of the 1910 John Parkinson landscape design that was demolished in 1951 to put in underground parking. More than 1500 people have <a href="https://www.change.org/p/mayor-garcetti-la-city-council-recreation-and-parks-don-t-re-envision-pershing-square-restore-pershing-square" target="_blank">signed the petition</a> asking for restoration and the campaign has been <a href="https://restorepershingsquare.blogspot.com/p/press-clips.html" target="_blank">prominently covered</a> by <em>The Los Angeles Times, Which Way LA? </em>and&nbsp;Curbed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently in response to the popular support for restoration, the Pershing Square Task Force has changed its name to Pershing SquaReNew, and announced a new mission statement. It is now identified as &#8220;a non-profit dedicated to supporting and facilitating the park&#8217;s revitalization&#8211;along with a number of efforts that will not only <strong>restore Pershing Square</strong>, but place Los Angeles on the map of inspiring, world-class public spaces.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please join social historians Kim Cooper and Richard Schave (LAVA, <a href="https://www.esotouric.com/" target="_blank">Esotouric</a>) at Pershing Square to hear what sort of restoration Pershing SquaReNew is proposing. (<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal;">Sorry, author&nbsp;</span><a style="font-style: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1626400083" target="_blank">Stephen Gee</a>&nbsp;will not be able to attend.)&nbsp;After the announcement, these principals of the Pershing Square Restoration Society will lead a free walking tour of nearby John Parkinson buildings, including those around his namesake Square. All are welcome&#8211;please spread the word!</p>

<p><em>Presenters</em>:</p>
<p>Mike Fratantoni, an <span class="caps">LASD</span> Deputy who sits on the board of the Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Museum, makes a return engagement to the crime lab to present two fascinating and complex cases which will explore the development of forensic investigation.</p>

Meiling combines a practicing forensic scientistâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s experience and an historianâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s passion for reconstructing the past.  For each of Deputy Fratantoniâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s case presentations, she will provide a â€œThen &amp; Nowâ€ forensic overview, highlighting technological breakthroughs, methodological changes and how the cases have influenced the development of modern forensic investigation.</p>
<p><em>Case One</em>: Poor Little Louise Peete</p>
<p>In 1920, a homeless Louise Peete turned her romantic attentions towards elderly mining executive Jacob Denton, and moved into his house off Wilshire Boulevard. In May, Denton disappeared. When his friends called, Louise claimed that Denton had gone into hiding after being disfigured in a sword fight. For months, she lived and entertained in Dentonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s mansion, until the police agreed to search the house. Dentonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s murdered body was discovered buried in the basement, but Louise Peete had flown the coop. Captured and tried, she was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in San Quentin. She served eighteen years, and was once again homeless. Good-hearted Margaret Logan offered Louise a position as paid companion and housekeeper. Five years later, Margaret vanished. Her body was discovered in the backyard of her Pacific Palisades home. Thanks to the forensic evidence gathered and interpreted by Ray Pinker, <span class="caps">LAPD</span> chemist and future director of the <span class="caps">CSULA</span> Criminalistics Department, Louise was found guilty of murder and executed in the California gas chamber in&nbsp;1947.</p>
<p><em>Case Two</em>: The End of Charlie Crawford</p>
<p>Charlie â€œThe Gray Wolfâ€ Crawford and newspaper editor Hebert Spencer were shot, Spencer fatally, in Crawfordâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Hollywood office on May 20, 1931.  The investigation and trials that followed are the stuff of Los Angeles legend. Crawford was a racketeer who was in with the crooked â€œCity Hall Crowdâ€ during Prohibition. He died in a hospital ward muttering with his last breath that heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d take the name of his killer to his grave. Forensic investigators in the <span class="caps">LAPD</span> went to work seeking the answer. Before they found it, David Clark, a former Assistant District Attorney and candidate for a municipal judgeship, walked into the Hall of Justice and confessed.  Homicide detectives were incredulous, and the forensic investigation continued.  The first trial resulted in a mistrial, the second in acquittal.  In his presentation, Deputy Frantantoni will walk us through the landmark forensic analysis and pull back the curtains on this rich and fascinating period of Los Angeles history, and a story so twisted, no less a noir master than Raymond Chandler fictionalized it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>To purchase a ticket for this special event, click <a href="https://esotouric.com/crimelabjuly2014" target="_blank">here.</a>&nbsp;</strong></em>If you&#8217;d like to be contacted when another crime lab tour and lecture are scheduled, <a style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;" href="/newsletter/subscriptions">subscribe</a><em> to LAVA&#8217;s occasional Crime Lab Newsletter.</em></p>
<p>Join us in the Cal State Los Angeles teaching crime lab for an afternoonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s inquiry into the development of new breakthroughs in forensic science coming out of the Criminalistics Department.</p>
<p>We are delighted to announce the debut crime lab appearance of Prof. <a href="https://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/draymon/" target="_blank">David Raymond</a>, Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at <span class="caps">CSULA</span>. Prof. Raymond will provide an overview of Forensic Engineering with a focus on his specialty, <a href="https://web.calstatela.edu/programs/biomechlab/" target="_blank">Forensic Injury Biomechanics</a>. The presentation will introduce attendees to the field of forensic engineering and subspecialties; including injury biomechanics. Dr. Raymond will provide some historical background on the genesis of this field along with modern applications of injury biomechanics in engineering design and in forensic applications. Finally Dr. Raymond will demonstrate the utility of biomechanics in forensic science through the presentation of real-world cases.</p>
<p>For the second presentation, <span class="caps">LAVA</span> crime lab host Prof. Donald Johnson will provide an overview of Blood Stain Patterning through his long working relationship with Dr. Raymond.</p>
<p>The first topic covered will be the development of an <a href="https://narrative.ly/unsolved-mysteries/the-sultan-of-spatter/" target="_blank">Automated Imaging System for Blood Stain Patterning</a>, demonstrating their work in producing more sophisticated mathematical modelsâ€”recognizing that trajectories are arcs, not straight lines, for example â€” leading up to a means by which wound origin and trajectories can be quickly processed by forensic investigators at crime scenes. Numerous real-life case examples will be used to illustrate this discussion.</p>
<p>Next Prof. Johnson will discuss their work on <a target="_blank">micro <span class="caps">RNA</span>,</a> which is leading to determination of wound of origin for blood stains. Using the 1990s-era <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/10/ukcrime.sandralaville" target="_blank">British murder case</a> against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Billie-Jo_Jenkins" target="_blank">Sion Jenkins</a> as a jumping off point, Prof. Johnson will explain the methodology and instruments by which his graduate students are learning how to pinpoint proteins in <span class="caps">RNA</span> specific to respective organs and account for them in blood stain patterns.</p>
<p>By proving the wound of origin for blood evidence, forensic scientists can discount the claims of suspects who insist a victimâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s blood at a crime scene got there by innocent means (nose bleed, minor accidental injury, etc.). Using the new analytical methods developed in Prof. Johnsonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s lab, a scientist can prove that the blood stain in question originated with bleeding from the lungs, and not from the mucus membrane in the victimâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s nasal passage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cloaked in mystery and, until modern times, available only to the elite, the orange has been known as the fruit of the gods and a symbol of health, wealth, and love. The dream of California, since its discovery by Europeans, has been that it is a place of plenty, of potential, of personal opportunity. When the orange and California were finally linked, their partnership created a compelling fantasy and a fantastic reality. The Orange and the Dream of California takes a lively, literary, and extraordinarily visual look at the symbiotic relationship between the Golden State and its â€œgolden apple.â€ The orange became a symbol of everything California promised, and California became the center of the Orange Empire. â€œThe orange and California have built upon one another for hundreds of years,â€ explains author David BoulÃ©, â€œcrafting a vision that appeals to our universal desire for beauty, health, enchantment, and reinvention.â€ Books will be available for purchase and personally signed by the author.</p>

<p>Join us in the Cal State Los Angeles teaching crime lab for an afternoon&#8217;s inquiry into the development of the science of forensic investigation in the L.A. area.</p>
<p>We are delighted to announce the debut crime lab appearance of crime reporter Frank Girardot, author of <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/rockefellermystery">Name Dropper: Investigating the Clark Rockefeller Mystery</a>.</em></p>
<p>Join Frank in the Cal State Los Angeles teaching crime lab, as he presents in depth on the fascinating Clark Rockefeller mystery, and offers a selection of memorable incidents from his crime reporterâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s notebook.</p>
<p><em>Presentation One:</em></p>
<p>Frankâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s first presentation will be on Clark Rockefeller, which is the tale of a teenaged German immigrant who remade himself into a welcome and respected member of Bostonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s wealthiest neighborhood. The story might have followed that oft-told American tale of opportunity for all, but like all good Hollywood scripts, the tale of Clark Rockefeller had a dark twist. Namely murder.</p>
<p>In April 2013, Rockefeller, whose real name is Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, was convicted in the 1985 slaying of John Sohus. Gerhartsreiter didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t only kill Sohus, he buried the trisected body in the backyard of a home in San Marino â€” one of L.A. wealthiest neighborhoods. And then he vanished along with Sohusâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> new wife Linda, a 6-foot, 200-pound, red-headed Amazon with a flair for dark science fiction and strange fantasy.</p>
<p>He may have left San Marino, but Gerhartsreiterâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s quest to become a member of wealthy and privileged American society continued. During the height of the Reagan Administration he worked under the assumed name of Christopher Crowe as a broker for some of Wall Streetâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s toniest firms. When the cops came looking for him, Crowe became Rockefeller and embarked upon one of the greatest cons ever pulled on high society. As Rockefeller, the onetime immigrant had a pad down the street from the United Nations. He hobnobbed with celebrities, collected art and bragged about his dogs.</p>
<p>Rockefeller eventually married Sandy Boss, a respected financial analyst with a seven-figure annual income. But when the couple got divorced and Clark kidnapped their daughter, the past came knocking.</p>
<p>The murder case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence that singularly might not have amounted to a conviction. Taken together the evidence, which included blood, fingerprints, old ID cards and a stolen car, was solid. What resulted in the conviction? Probably a simple light shone on a plastic bag sold in a university bookstore for a very limited period of time. The man once known as Rockefeller is now simply Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, 52, a resident of a medium security prison in the San Joaquin Valley serving out a 25-to-life sentence for killing John Sohus.</p>
<p>As for Linda? She has never resurfaced.</p>
<p>For Frankâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s second lecture, he will lower his guard, roll up his sleeves, and look back on three decades in the newspaper business reporting on criminal investigations and the law enforcement agencies which conduct them, distilling for us the best and the worst, like how a murderous tagger might as well have signed his name at the crime scene, or the paramedics who left brain matter on a dead manâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s driveway for his family to clean up, or a con-man who used Craigslist to bilk dozens of needy would-be renters, and what still keeps him up at night: an unsolved double murder in Monrovia that occurred during a ride-along in the 1990s.</p>
