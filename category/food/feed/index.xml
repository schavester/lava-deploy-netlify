										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Please use the form on the left to register for this event. No &#8220;Plus Ones.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ABOUT THIS EVENT:</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="caps">LAVA</span> â€“ The Los Angeles Visionaries Association is pleased to announce a free roof-top screening of a newly-discovered circa 1949 short color film of Main Street and other downtown Los Angeles locations, the Union Rescue Mission-produced <em>Of Scrap &amp; Steel</em>. The screening is in conjunction with a series of downtown stories on the In <span class="caps">SRO</span> Land time travel blog, featuring <a href="https://insroland.org/urm/urmarchiveproject" target="_blank">material</a> from the Union Rescue Mission Archives.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ABOUT</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FILM</span>: In mid-1948 the Board of Directors of the Union Rescue Mission approved the expenditure of $5,000 to make the 30-minute film Of Scrap &amp; Steel which portrays the redemption and good works of Arthur Hawkins, an alcoholic executive who ended up on the streets of Los Angeles and whose life was saved when he turned to the <span class="caps">URM</span> for help. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_Hall" target="_blank">Porter Hall</a> (Arthur Hawkins) is one of only two actors in a film otherwise populated by real Los Angeles characters. (You may recall Hallâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s performance as the pesky guy on the train in Double Indemnity.)</p>
<p><em>Of Scrap &amp; Steel</em> was only shown in screenings organized by the <span class="caps">URM</span> or related organizations, and would have been completely lost if Liz Mooradian, <span class="caps">URM</span> historian, had not saved a deteriorating 16mm print and had it transferred to video before it was too late. <em>Of Scrap &amp; Steel</em> is just one of the remarkable artifacts discovered in the Union Rescue Mission archives and explored in the <a href="https://insroland.org/urm/urmarchiveproject" target="_blank">In <span class="caps">SRO</span> Land blog</a>.</p>
<p>This entertaining and powerful short film is a compelling snapshot of life on Skid Row (Main Street) circa 1949, and a fascinating document of the important work that the <span class="caps">URM</span> continues to do with the most needy in the community. Although downtown Los Angeles features in numerous noir films, it is extremely rare to see color images of eastern downtown, and rarer still to see full-color live-action footage of the vibrant street scene that included rescue missions, pawn shops, amusement parlors, bars, restaurants and the ever-patrolling paddy wagon in search of drunkards to haul away to jail or County work crews.</p>
<p>This free rooftop screening is jointly organized by <span class="caps">LAVA</span>â€“The Los Angeles Visionaries Association, the <a href="https://insroland.org/" target="_blank">In <span class="caps">SRO</span> Land</a> time travel blog and the <a href="https://urm.org/" target="_blank">Union Rescue Mission</a>. Attendees are encouraged to dress warmly for the cool night air.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Refreshments will be provided compliments of URM.</span></p>
<p>This screening is held in conjunction with the <a href="/urmwalk5" target="_blank">Skid Row Walking Tour</a>, a separate free event beginning two hours before the screening. Separate registration for each event is required if you wish to attend both the screening and walking tour.</p>
<p>Nearest Metro station is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Tokyo/Arts_District_(Los_Angeles_Metro_station)" target="_blank">Little Tokyo</a>.</p>
<p>Limited free parking is available at the <span class="caps">URM</span>â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s underground parking lot. Just tell the attendant you are there for the film. Please carpool: if each guest arrives with one other person in their car, there should be enough parking for all. Those arriving later will have to leave their keys with the parking attendant.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be overflow parking in the San Julian parking lot located just behind the <span class="caps">URM</span>, on San Julian Street between 5th &amp; 6th Streets, on the east side of the street, adjacent to <span class="caps">URM</span>. Registered attendees will be able to enter the <span class="caps">URM</span> from the Womenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s entrance on San Julian. There will be ample staff to direct you from the lot to this entrance.</p>
<p>In the event of rain, we will screen the film in the Chapel.</p>
<p>Schedule</p>
<p>6pm &#8211; Doors open (reserved guests check in at the main entrance and are sent up to the roof)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This tour has been honored as an &#8220;Editor Pick &#8211; City Gem&#8221; by Flavorpill L.A.</p>
<p>A criminal and gastronomical excursion into the San Gabriel Valley, Blood &amp; Dumplings rolls through Alhambra, Temple City, Monterey Park, Rosemead and El Monte, revealing dozens of weird, forgotten crimes and oddities from the valley&#8217;s past. Highlights include the mysterious Man from Mars Bandit, the lesbian couple whose bickering over spending cash resulted in one pumping the other full of downers until she died, the young bride who spent her wedding day buried under her parents&#8217; house, the battling neo-Nazis of El Monte, Phil Spector&#8217;s spooky castle and the little bar where James Ellroy&#8217;s murdered mother Jean had her last drink. The tour includes a selection of dumplings from one of the San Gabriel Valley&#8217;s best Chinese restaurants.(Vegetarian passengers, please let us know your food preference several days before we depart.) If using a gift certificate, please note that this tour has an additional $5 dumpling fee, payable in cash or check at the bus door.</p>
<p>Passenger Feedback &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken the famous &#8216;Ghostly New Orleans&#8217; and &#8216;Mysteries of Venice, Italy&#8217; tours and also enthusiastically enjoyed London&#8217;s &#8216;Jack the Ripper of Whitehall&#8217; tour, and I assure you none surpasses Richard Schave and Kim Cooper&#8217;s Esotouric &#8220;Blood &amp; Dumplings&#8221; bus excursion into the bizarrely memorable but rarely-visited regions of East Los Angeles. As humorous and constantly entertaining as it is thoroughly researched, this lovingly crafted 4-hour tour is essential for any tourist or long-term denizen who wishes to comprehend the many fascinating characters and their dark, odd-ball deeds which have contributed to Los Angeles&#8217; nutty history. Very comfortable, carefully prepared, weirdly funny, and unforgettable.&#8221; (F.A.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>An important message from LAVA &#8211; September 9, 2014</strong></p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>It is with no small amount of regret that we are putting the monthly LAVA Sunday Salon and Broadway on My Mind walking tour series on hiatus, effective immediately. Both events take place at Les Noces du Figaro restaurant, which is closing down for several months of renovations.</p>
<p>We will be working closely with Jonathan Mgaieth of Figaro to determine a relaunch date as soon as the restaurant reopens, hopefully in early 2015. So stay tuned, and we hope to see you at other LAVA events in the meantime.</p>
<p>Please know that your continued thoughts and good will are the rock upon which LAVA builds its house.</p>
<p>With thanks for your understanding, we remain,<br />Richard Schave and Kim Cooper<br />LAVA &#8211; The Los Angeles Visionaries Association</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Join&nbsp;<span class="caps">LAVA</span>&nbsp;for our revived free monthly Sunday Salon series. We return to South Broadway, to the mezzanine of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LesNocesDuFigaro" target="_blank">Les Noces du Figaro</a>, which was recently opened by the family behind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.figarobistrot.com/">Figaro Bistro</a>&nbsp;in Los Feliz. This handsome space was formerly&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/historylosangeles/schaber-s-cafeteria" target="_blank">Schaber&#8217;s Cafeteria</a>&nbsp;(Charles F. Plummer, 1928), and the mezzanine features wonderful views of the&nbsp;<a href="https://cinematreasures.org/theaters/5" target="_blank">Los Angeles Theatre</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">On the last Sunday of each month, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles (noon-2pm), for a structured Salon featuring formal presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.  If you&#8217;re interested in joining LAVA as a creative contributor or an attendee, we recommend Salon attendance as an introduction to this growing community. We also recommend the eclairs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Read about the original <a href="/cliftonsalons" target="_blank">Sunday Salon at Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Presentation One: Jean Harlow Part 2</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">The name resonates. Blonde Bombshell. Platinum Blonde. The labels applied by press agents during Jean Harlow&#8217;s seven-year career still carry a charge seventy years later. Harlow created the mold: the first blonde sex symbol who captured the attention of a nation, then touched their hearts with her genuine warmth and candor. At a time when Harlow&#8217;s star shone its brightest, Los Angeles and the movies gave birth to a district that exists as much in the mind as on the map. Hollywood historian Darrell Rooney is co-author of <em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1883318963" target="_blank">Harlow In Hollywood</a>. </em><em>H</em>e returns to the LAVA Sunday Salon to pick up where he left off at his <a href="/salon-rooney-january2014" target="_blank">January 2014 presentation</a>, with Jean Harlow&#8217;s story following the mysterious death of her husband Paul Bern.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Presentation Two: Preserving the Legacy of Wurdman &amp; Beckett&#8217;s Animal Hospital in West Hollywood</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">West Hollywood residents and area historians Kate Eggert and Krisy Gosney of <a href="https://deadhistoryproject.com/" target="_blank">Dead History Project</a> fell into historic preservation activism when two 110-year-old bungalows on their street were threatened with demolition. Everyone said they wouldnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t win&#8230; until they did.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">Recently, they went to a West Hollywood Historic Preservation Commission meeting on a whim. The Commission discussed a </span>1938 Wurdeman &amp; Becket streamline moderne<span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;animal hospital and a 1959 Barry Berkus mid-century modern office building, both slated for demolition and the site for redevelopment. They were told these buildings were a lost cause. But as a little research revealed the significance of the site, they knew they would fight. Their grassroots&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/savetheSMBstreamlinemoderne" target="_blank">preservation campaign</a> has garnered significant media attention and the support of the Los Angeles Conservancy, Art Deco Society, the family of architect Welton Becket and hundreds of passionate citizens. Responding to the rising community outcry, the developer has begun suggesting ways in which the Wurdeman &amp; Beckett structure can be integrated into a modern building.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;">This LAVA presentation is about the process through which Kate and Krisy are tackling the biggest preservation fight of their careers, the highs and lows, and the delicate dance of politics, ego, money and information that impacts any community when developers seek to build on an historic site.</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>To sign up for this free event: </strong>First <a href="/user">register</a> as a user on this site, and then return to this page. Refresh the page and the signup tab will appear just to the left, above this paragraph. Click &#8220;signup&#8221; and reserve your spot. No plus-ones; each guest must register individually.</p>
<p><span class="caps">LAVA</span> â€“ The Los Angeles Visionaries Association is pleased to announce a free roof-top screening of a newly-discovered circa 1949 short color film of Main Street and other downtown Los Angeles locations, the Union Rescue Mission-produced <em>Of Scrap &amp; Steel</em>. The screening is in conjunction with a series of downtown stories on the In <span class="caps">SRO</span> Land time travel blog, featuring <a href="https://insroland.org/urm/urmarchiveproject" target="_blank">material</a> from the Union Rescue Mission Archives.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ABOUT</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FILM</span>: In mid-1948 the Board of Directors of the Union Rescue Mission approved the expenditure of $5,000 to make the 30-minute film Of Scrap &amp; Steel which portrays the redemption and good works of Arthur Hawkins, an alcoholic executive who ended up on the streets of Los Angeles and whose life was saved when he turned to the <span class="caps">URM</span> for help. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_Hall" target="_blank">Porter Hall</a> (Arthur Hawkins) is one of only two actors in a film otherwise populated by real Los Angeles characters. (You may recall Hallâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s performance as the pesky guy on the train in Double Indemnity.)</p>
<p><em>Of Scrap &amp; Steel</em> was only shown in screenings organized by the <span class="caps">URM</span> or related organizations, and would have been completely lost if Liz Mooradian, <span class="caps">URM</span> historian, had not saved a deteriorating 16mm print and had it transferred to video before it was too late. <em>Of Scrap &amp; Steel</em> is just one of the remarkable artifacts discovered in the Union Rescue Mission archives and explored in the <a href="https://insroland.org/urm/urmarchiveproject" target="_blank">In <span class="caps">SRO</span> Land blog</a>.</p>
<p>This entertaining and powerful short film is a compelling snapshot of life on Skid Row (Main Street) circa 1949, and a fascinating document of the important work that the <span class="caps">URM</span> continues to do with the most needy in the community. Although downtown Los Angeles features in numerous noir films, it is extremely rare to see color images of eastern downtown, and rarer still to see full-color live-action footage of the vibrant street scene that included rescue missions, pawn shops, amusement parlors, bars, restaurants and the ever-patrolling paddy wagon in search of drunkards to haul away to jail or County work crews.</p>
<p>This free rooftop screening is jointly organized by <span class="caps">LAVA</span> â€“ The Los Angeles Visionaries Association, the <a href="https://insroland.org/" target="_blank">In <span class="caps">SRO</span> Land</a> time travel blog and the <a href="https://urm.org/" target="_blank">Union Rescue Mission</a>. Seating will be provided, and attendees are encouraged to dress warmly for the cool night air.</p>
<p>Gourmet box dinners: â€œMeals with a purposeâ€ will be available for purchase ($5, cash only), with a choice of sandwich (vegetarian, roast beef or turkey), cookie, fruit, or chips.  Soft Drinks ($1, cash only). Coffee (decaf), hot tea, cold water, and fresh popcorn compliments of the <span class="caps">URM</span>.  100% of proceeds from your meal donation goes to the <span class="caps">URM</span>, and the proceeds from each dinner will feed two other people.</p>
<p>This screening is held in conjunction with the <a href="/urmwalk4" target="_blank">Skid Row Walking Tour</a>, a separate free event beginning two hours before the screening. Separate registration for each event is required if you wish to attend both the screening and walking tour.</p>
<p>Nearest Metro station is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Tokyo/Arts_District_(Los_Angeles_Metro_station)" target="_blank">Little Tokyo</a>.</p>
<p>Limited free parking is available at the <span class="caps">URM</span>â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s underground parking lot. Just tell the attendant you are there for the film. Please carpool: if each guest arrives with one other person in their car, there should be enough parking for all. Those arriving later will have to leave their keys with the parking attendant.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be overflow parking in the San Julian parking lot located just behind the <span class="caps">URM</span>, on San Julian Street between 5th &amp; 6th Streets, on the east side of the street, adjacent to <span class="caps">URM</span>.  Registered attendees will be able to enter the <span class="caps">URM</span> from the Womenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s entrance on San Julian.  There will be ample staff to direct you from the lot to this entrance.</p>
<p>In the event of rain, we will screen the film in the Chapel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Join&nbsp;<span class="caps">LAVA</span>&nbsp;for our revived free monthly Sunday Salon series. We return to South Broadway, to the mezzanine of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LesNocesDuFigaro" target="_blank">Les Noces du Figaro</a>, which was recently opened by the family behind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.figarobistrot.com/">Figaro Bistro</a>&nbsp;in Los Feliz. This handsome space was formerly&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/historylosangeles/schaber-s-cafeteria" target="_blank">Schaber&#8217;s Cafeteria</a>&nbsp;(Charles F.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">On the last Sunday of each month, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles (noon-2pm), for a structured Salon featuring formal presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.  If you&#8217;re interested in joining LAVA as a creative contributor or an attendee, we recommend Salon attendance as an introduction to this growing community. We also recommend the eclairs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Read about the original Sunday Salon at Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria&nbsp;<a href="/cliftonsalons" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A Note On Arriving Downtown on Sunday</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">The Made In America concert will close off the Civic Center (the area around City Hall) for the whole weekend.  Please do not, if you are driving, take the 101 freeway to come downtown, as you will be plagued with festival detours.  The Pershing Square Metro Station is the closest transit stop to Cafe Figaro. If you are driving, it is easy to access 7th &amp; Broadway if arriving via the 10 freeway, the 60 or the 5. We recommend taking public transportation, or allowing yourself more time than usual if you are driving.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation One:</strong><strong>&nbsp;Charlie Parker&#8217;s Central Avenue Jazz&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Alto saxophonist Charlie Parker arrived at Los Angeles&#8217; Union<strong> </strong>Station in December of 1945 all but tied to his seat. Somewhere in the southwestern desert his heroin withdrawals had caught up with him and the rest of the band knew they were going to be in for a long trip. But none was going to be as long as Parker&#8217;s.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">The two titans of bebop, Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, had booked a winter gig in sunny LA.  Six nights a week in a Hollywood nightclub was a nice way to get out of the City and introduce a new audience to their innovative bebop sounds &#8212; but Parker&#8217;s spiraling drug problem was a liability before the band had even packed their bags.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">When the residency finally ended, relationships were in shambles, box office receipts were disappointing and the band was eager to just get home. But Parker didn&#8217;t show up for the flight. It took him over a year to finally get out of Los Angeles. During his extended stay, Parker had disastrous recording sessions, transcendent recording sessions, he signed over royalties to his drug dealer, lit his hotel room on fire and eventually served six months in a mental institution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Author Sean J. O&#8217;Connell chronicles Los Angeles&#8217;s unique 20th century jazz scene in his newest book,&nbsp;<a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/146713130X" target="_blank"><em>Los Angeles&#8217;s Central Avenue Jazz.</em></a> For his first LAVA presentation, he will chart the journey of jazz&#8217; greatest destructive genius through the nightclubs and back alleys of 1940s Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation Two:</strong><strong> Living a Magickal Life</strong></p>
<p>What is magick and how does one live it? From kitchen witchery and crafting to ceremonial magic, join us to examine the core principles underlying magick and discover ways to enrich your life by creating change in accord with Will.</p>
<p>Soror Lilya is an Initiate of <a href="https://www.starsapphire-oto.org/" target="_blank">Ordo Templi Orientis</a>, a Thelemite and a Crafter who has been working with Magick for over 20 years.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The Salon will be followed by a free walking tour, <a href="/flaneur-broadway-on-my-mind-12" target="_blank">The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway on My Mind walking tour #12</a>. Please visit the tour series </span><a style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;" href="/flaneur-broadway-on-my-mind-landing" target="_blank">Landing Page</a><span style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;"> for videos and descriptions of past tours and the goals of the series.</span></p>

<p><strong>Presentation One</strong> <em>The Mystique of the Orange.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Cloaked in mystery and available only to the elite until modern times, the orange has been known as the fruit of the gods, the food of emperors, a token of gratitude and a symbol of health, wealth and love. Since it entered history, the dream of California has been that it is a place of plenty, of potential, of personal opportunity. The orange became a glowing symbol of this dream. <a title="David Boule" href="https://www.angelcitypress.com/collections/authors-david-boule" target="_blank">David BoulÃ©</a>, author of the recently released <a title="Orange &amp; the California Dream" href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/1883318629" target="_blank"><em>The Orange and the Dream of California</em></a> (Angel City Press), will take a lively, literary and extraordinarily visual look at this colorful and captivating history and reveal the tremendous impact of the orange on the culture and development of California, and how these two entities have built on one another to feed the imagination and conjure a compelling fantasy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">A third generation Californian, David has a lifelong fascination with the history, culture, achievements and uniqueness of the region. â€œThe enduring image of California as paradise and the orange as unique among all fruit is because, partially, these things are true. These traits have then been magnified by poets and boosters, artists and hucksters, songwriters and bureaucrats<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal;">â€”</span>with both artistic and commercial motivation<span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal;">â€”</span>to appeal to peopleâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s continuing desire to believe that such exceptional perfection can really exist,â€ he says.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation Two</strong> <em>Charlie Chaplin &amp; Keystoneâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Centennial.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">One hundred years ago, Charlie Chaplin made his film debut in Mack Sennettâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Keystone Comedies. Within the year, he would become the biggest star in motion pictures, going on to set filmmaking artistic standards that some feel have never be duplicated. During that first year of 1914, Chaplin filmed in various Los Angeles neighborhoods, andâ€”in several casesâ€”used actual events (ranging from the dedication of a Wilmington wharf to various auto races on streets and tracks) as a backdrop for his comedies. <a title="Brent's Senett Blog" href="https://macksennett.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Brent E. Walker</a>, author of <a title="Mack Sennett's Fun Factory" href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0786477113" target="_blank"><em>Mack Sennettâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Fun Factory</em></a>, will take us on a guided tour of Chaplin in 1914, and the Los Angeles history revealed in these early comedies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><span class="caps">PLEASE</span> <span class="caps">NOTE</span>: this Sunday Salon will be slightly longer than usual in order to accommodate three talks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">The second presentation will end at 1:45pm. The third presentation runs from 2:00pm-2:30pm, and will serve as an introduction to the <a href="/flaneur-broadway-on-my-mind-11">Broadway On My Mind Walking Tour</a> which immediately follows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;"><strong>Presentation Three</strong>: Open Street Map &amp; Historical Overlays</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">Join us as <a href="https://www.tmcnet.com/tmcnet/Columnists/columnist.aspx?id=100125">Charlotte Wolter</a> explains how <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> is creating an open, free map of the world that anyone can use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">It works by marshaling the energies and knowledge of tens of thousands of volunteers around the globe who contribute their time and local knowledge in a phenomenon known as â€œcrowd-sourcing,â€ focusing this mass of people in a common effort for the common good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">[OpenStreetMap] is also a sophisticated technical effort, one in which some of the best minds in geographic / mapping science and computing have contributed their abilities to create the storage system that keeps all of OpenStreetMapsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> huge data files safe and quick to access.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">These programmers also have helped to develop an online mapping interface that make it easy for anyone to contribute to OpenStreetMap. If you have an interest in the history of a place, OpenStreetMap (and its corollary, <a href="https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/">OpenHistoricalMap</a>) are here to provide a way to put that history, literally, on the map.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">If youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d like to map historical sites that still exist, youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll use OpenStreetMap. For lost locations, <a href="https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/">OpenHistoricalMap</a> is the place where contributors can provide reconstructions of places that existed in the past, whether the buildings still exist today or not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;">In this presentation, you will have an opportunity to try your hand at contributing to OpenStreetMap, using your knowledge of historic sites in Los Angeles. You can even bring your laptop computer if youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d like to learn how to edit Open StreetMap at home. The tools and techniques youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll discover in this presentation will also be useful if youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d like to add lost locations to <a href="https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/">OpenHistoricalMap</a> .</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The Salon will be followed by a free walking tour,&nbsp;</span><a style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;" title="The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway Master Streetscape Walking Tour #11" href="/flaneur-broadway-on-my-mind-11" target="_blank">The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway on My Mind walking tour #11</a><span style="font-size: 12px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Future Studio Gallery is hosting a Depressed Cake Shop Pop-up with art by Nancy Buchanan and cakes and pastries by whomsoever would like to donate (like you, perhaps). 100% of proceeds from the bake sale will benefit the Northeast Wellness Centerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Positive Visions program.</p>
<p>Nancy Buchananâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s recent series continues her investigation of excesses in an age of income disparity, and the juxtaposition of desire vs. repulsion. Nancy will show photographic prints and screenprints of grey cakes and cupcakes.</p>
<p>The Northeast Wellness Center is an LA county dept. serving stakeholders and community partners in providing clinically competent, culturally sensitive, and linguistically appropriate mental health services to clients in the least restrictive manner possible. Their North East LA office is a neighbor of the gallery.</p>
<p>The Depressed Cake Shop is an all-volunteer pop-up concept, conceived by Emma Cakehead in the UK, selling grey-colored cakes and other baked goods with the purpose of raising awareness about mental health issues. More than 30 Depressed Cake Shops have popped up all over the worldâ€”from Scotland to San Francisco since the first shop opened in Aug. 2013.</p>
