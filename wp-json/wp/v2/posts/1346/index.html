Blonde Bombshell. Platinum Blonde. The labels applied by press agents during Jean Harlow&#8217;s seven-year career still carry a charge seventy years later. Harlow created the mold: the first blonde sex symbol who captured the attention of a nation, then touched their hearts with her genuine warmth and candor. At a time when Harlow&#8217;s star shone its brightest, Los Angeles and the movies gave birth to a district that exists as much in the mind as on the map.

Everyone said they wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win&#8230; until they did.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">Recently, they went to a West Hollywood Historic Preservation Commission meeting on a whim. The Commission discussed a <\/span>1938 Wurdeman &amp; Becket streamline moderne<span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">&nbsp;animal hospital and a 1959 Barry Berkus mid-century modern office building, both slated for demolition and the site for redevelopment. They were told these buildings were a lost cause. But as a little research revealed the significance of the site, they knew they would fight. Their grassroots&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/savetheSMBstreamlinemoderne\" target=\"_blank\">preservation campaign<\/a> has garnered significant media attention and the support of the Los Angeles Conservancy, Art Deco Society, the family of architect Welton Becket and hundreds of passionate citizens. Responding to the rising community outcry, the developer has begun suggesting ways in which the Wurdeman &amp; Beckett structure can be integrated into a modern building.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">This LAVA presentation is about the process through which Kate and Krisy are tackling the biggest preservation fight of their careers, the highs and lows, and the delicate dance of politics, ego, money and information that impacts any community when developers seek to build on an historic site.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1346\" data-postid=\"1346\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1346 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An important message from LAVA &#8211; September 9, 2014 Dear friends, It is with no small amount of regret that we are putting the monthly LAVA Sunday Salon and Broadway on My Mind walking tour series on hiatus, effective immediately.
