The screening is in conjunction with a series of downtown stories on the In <span class=\"caps\">SRO<\/span> Land time travel blog, featuring <a href=\"http:\/\/insroland.org\/urm\/urmarchiveproject\" target=\"_blank\">material<\/a> from the Union Rescue Mission Archives.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">ABOUT<\/span> <span class=\"caps\">THE<\/span> <span class=\"caps\">FILM<\/span>: In mid-1948 the Board of Directors of the Union Rescue Mission approved the expenditure of $5,000 to make the 30-minute film Of Scrap &amp; Steel which portrays the redemption and good works of Arthur Hawkins, an alcoholic executive who ended up on the streets of Los Angeles and whose life was saved when he turned to the <span class=\"caps\">URM<\/span> for help. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Porter_Hall\" target=\"_blank\">Porter Hall<\/a> (Arthur Hawkins) is one of only two actors in a film otherwise populated by real Los Angeles characters. (You may recall Hall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance as the pesky guy on the train in Double Indemnity.)<\/p>\n<p><em>Of Scrap &amp; Steel<\/em> was only shown in screenings organized by the <span class=\"caps\">URM<\/span> or related organizations, and would have been completely lost if Liz Mooradian, <span class=\"caps\">URM<\/span> historian, had not saved a deteriorating 16mm print and had it transferred to video before it was too late. <em>Of Scrap &amp; Steel<\/em> is just one of the remarkable artifacts discovered in the Union Rescue Mission archives and explored in the <a href=\"http:\/\/insroland.org\/urm\/urmarchiveproject\" target=\"_blank\">In <span class=\"caps\">SRO<\/span> Land blog<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This entertaining and powerful short film is a compelling snapshot of life on Skid Row (Main Street) circa 1949, and a fascinating document of the important work that the <span class=\"caps\">URM<\/span> continues to do with the most needy in the community. Although downtown Los Angeles features in numerous noir films, it is extremely rare to see color images of eastern downtown, and rarer still to see full-color live-action footage of the vibrant street scene that included rescue missions, pawn shops, amusement parlors, bars, restaurants and the ever-patrolling paddy wagon in search of drunkards to haul away to jail or County work crews.<\/p>\n<p>This free rooftop screening is jointly organized by <span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span>\u00e2\u20ac\u201cThe Los Angeles Visionaries Association, the <a href=\"http:\/\/insroland.org\" target=\"_blank\">In <span class=\"caps\">SRO<\/span> Land<\/a> time travel blog and the <a href=\"http:\/\/urm.org\" target=\"_blank\">Union Rescue Mission<\/a>.

Just tell the attendant you are there for the film. Please carpool: if each guest arrives with one other person in their car, there should be enough parking for all. Those arriving later will have to leave their keys with the parking attendant.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, there will be overflow parking in the San Julian parking lot located just behind the <span class=\"caps\">URM<\/span>, on San Julian Street between 5th &amp; 6th Streets, on the east side of the street, adjacent to <span class=\"caps\">URM<\/span>.
