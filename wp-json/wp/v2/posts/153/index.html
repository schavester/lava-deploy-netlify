But here&#8217;s the deal: On and off since I was 9 or so (I&#8217;m now 63), I have done pen-and-crayon (with some watercolor) drawings of imaginary cities, mostly informed by the way L.A., S.F. and California appear to a largely untrained illustrator.<\/p>\n<p>They&#8217;re full of streets and buildings, people, freeways and beaches, power plants and broad, palm-lined arterials. They&#8217;re mostly drawn on white shelf-lining paper, and the longest one (1960-62) is 60 yards long. Because they were drawn over many years, they in effect comprise a rough chronological snapshot of what (mostly) Cali has looked like to me: sprawling suburban tracts announced by&nbsp;&#8220;Vets No Down!&#8221; billboards (60s), the mansard-roofs of fast-food franchises (70s), theater and concert venues whose marquees hype long gone films and idealized pop-music bills.<\/p>\n<p>Somehow, though, it is, like the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.luxuriamusic.com\/atomic-cocktail-0\" target=\"_blank\">weekly radio show<\/a> I do, all sort of contemporaneous, the accretion of architecture, signage and sensibility&nbsp;all meant to bear the time signature of the eternal Now, which, I suppose, is a key part of the California Dream that informed my growing up and lifelong residence here. I started the latest cityscape,&nbsp;&#8220;Majestic Blvd.,&#8221; in February 2006 when I lost my last real job. It&#8217;s just under 60 feet now and growing. I will also bring and show one scroll of earlier vintage.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-153\" data-postid=\"153\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-153 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>WHAT: Visionary Gene Sculatti exhibits his scrolls at the LAVA Sunday Salon, March 28, 1pm at Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria.
