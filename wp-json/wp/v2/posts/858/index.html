While chasing his dream of becoming a writer, Tully rode the rails and worked as a tree surgeon, boxer, and newspaper reporter. All the while, he was crafting his memories into a dark and original chronicle of the American underclass. When he began to set his experiences onto paper in a style that was Hard Boiled before the genre existed, he became a literary sensation.<\/p>\n<p>Read the <a href=\"http:\/\/archive.org\/download\/JimTullyOneSheet\/TullyFlyer.pdf\" target=\"new\">Jim Tully \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOne Sheet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122<\/a><\/p>\n<p>At October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Salon, Jim Tully\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biographers Mark Dawidziak and Paul Bauer will seek to answer the fundamental question: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Jim Tully still a household name?\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Tully exploded onto the scene with a stream of critically acclaimed novels, among them <em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/1606350005\" target=\"_blank\">Beggars of Life<\/a><\/em> (1924), <em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/1606350013\" target=\"_blank\">Circus Parade<\/a><\/em> (1927), <em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/1606350234\" target=\"_blank\">Shanty Irish<\/a><\/em> (1928), <em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/B0018EYKKI\" target=\"_blank\">Shadows of Men<\/a><\/em> (1930) and <em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/B00085NF8G\" target=\"_blank\">Blood on the Moon<\/a><\/em> (1931). Yet the books were out-of-print for decades, their author forgotten.<\/p>\n<p>To answer this question, Mark Dawidziak and Paul Bauer must look to the Hollywood of 1912, to the sleepy little suburb that Tully found and watched grow up around him, as he built his incongruous twin careers as motion picture&nbsp;publicist and independent writer. From his piercing insights into and deep ambivalence toward his longtime employer, Charlie Chaplin, to anecdotes of great friendships with W. C. Fields, Jack Dempsey, Damon Runyon, Lon Chaney, Frank Capra, and Erich von Stroheim, Tully exhibited a lust for life which was only surpassed by his devotion to his craft.  By 1930 Tully was a major American author, and had launched a parallel career as a successful journalist. Both his novels and journalistic expos\u00c3\u00a9s shook the country and his peer group in Hollywood.<\/p>\n<p>But Tully\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s novel <em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/0983031436\" target=\"_blank\">Ladies In The Parlor<\/a><\/em> (1935), was declared obscene and most copies destroyed, and Chaplin successfully prevented Tully\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s publisher from releasing a biography of the actor. By the mid-1940s, crippling physical ailments and family heartbreak left the writer on the ropes.  With his death in 1947, his name quietly slipped from the front ranks of American Letters and into obscurity.<\/p>\n<p>Since 2009, Kent State University Press has been rectifying this long neglect with a series of Tully reprints. And in 2011, it published Mark Dawidziak and Paul Bauer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s definitive biography,&nbsp;<em><a style=\"font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\" href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/1606350765\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Tully: American Writer, Irish Rover, Hollywood Brawler<\/a><span style=\"font-style: normal;\">,<\/span><\/em>&nbsp;drawing on new information found in the Tully papers at UCLA Special Collections.<\/p>\n<p>The time is ripe for a revival of interest in this fascinating American character, and we invite you to play a part in it at the October Salon.<\/p>\n<p>Paul Bauer cowrote Frazier Robinson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s autobiography, Catching Dreams: My Life in the Negro Baseball Leagues.
