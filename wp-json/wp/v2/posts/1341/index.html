Since this whole Chicken Boy thing started for us in 1984, people have been gifting us with chicken ephemera, and lots of it. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve unpacked a bunch of it and put it on display. Everything from wind-up toys to socks, booklets to figurines, and a lot more.<\/p>\n<p>SOUVIES of L.A.<br \/>We are re-imagining the tiny and funny Chicken Boy Souvenir Stand and adding more L.A.-ish, Highland Park-ish, North East L.A.-ish, Golden State-ish, and Historic Route 66-ish souvenirs. We are endeavoring to source interesting, unique merchandise (amazingly not that easy to find), even producing some ourselves. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153(Mostly) Cheep (Always) Cheerful Souvies of L.A.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is our slogan (prices start at 75\u00c2\u00a2). To start, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got some postcards and pencils that we designed, and will be adding to the selection as we go. Abbreviated but regular hours and updated web shop coming soon too. <\/p>\n<p>APRONS of the FUTURE<br \/>We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve started designing aprons (we love aprons), and will have some sample ones available for you to check out. We also have a few denim market bags (heavy duty, and washable). A few stock apron designs will be available in the coming months at the Souvenir Stand and the updated web shop. Made in Highland Park.<\/p>\n<p>ANTIQUE ASIAN BASKETS FOR SALE<br \/>We have acquired a bunch of large, beautiful antique Chinese &amp; Japanese baskets that you can peruse and purchase at fantastically affordable prices. There are also some vases and other Asian d\u00c3\u00a9cor items to browse.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1341\" data-postid=\"1341\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1341 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Could this be the answer to the mysterious disappearance of Amelia Earhart?
