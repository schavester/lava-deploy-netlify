If you&#8217;ve already seen her first LAVA demonstration at the June 2010 Salon, this is a different style, redefined by her recent public drapings for Kansas City&#8217;s infamous Dr. Sketchy&#8217;s burlesque life drawing classes.&nbsp; Get a preview (filmed by Don Maxwell&nbsp; and presented by Pistol Threads&#8217; Christel Highland) at <a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/15717235\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/vimeo.com\/15717235<\/a>.
