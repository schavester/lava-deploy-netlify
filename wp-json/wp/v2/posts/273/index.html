A highlight of his talk came when Miguel Angel displayed a few recently excavated beer, wine and perfume bottles discovered during construction, which are believed to date from circa 1840-50.<\/p>\n<p>Next up, Visionary <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/user\/37\" target=\"_blank\">Joan Renner<\/a> spoke on the dark and nefarious history of L.A.&#8217;s old Chinatown (where Union Station stands today). From opium dens to fallen women, bartered babies to subterranean tunnels of vice, Chinatown embodied the weirdest fantasies of early 20th century Angelenoes, and Joan&#8217;s illustrated talk was both fascinating and horrifying. And then Visionary <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/user\/45\" target=\"_blank\">Mike the Poet<\/a> closed the proceedings with a rousing rhyme celebrating the common language shared by all LA people: East Side rock and roll.<\/p>\n<p>For video of the archeological discoveries, click <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JhM1h6sbuU8\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.
