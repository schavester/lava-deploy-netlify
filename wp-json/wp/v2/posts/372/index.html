Maybe it&#8217;s tiki-themed bowling alley&#8230; or a no-tell motel named after your secret crush&#8230; or the lone Victorian farmhouse left behind when progress came to town. Interested &#8220;developers&#8221; are invited to come view the scroll in progress and talk about the possibilities with the artist. Stake your claim, and then follow your development&#8217;s progress on the LAVA blog between January and June, when Gene will return to the LAVA Salon to unveil the expanded scroll to the lucky &#8220;property owners.&#8221; <strong>ABOUT GENE SCULATTI&#8217;S SCROLLS:<\/strong> Since the age of 9, Sculatti, 63, has created imaginary horizontal  cities packed with fascinating details that reflect his evolving  obsessions: googie signage, soaring bridges, skyscrapers, suburbs,  amusement parks and much more. Join us for a rare opportunity to get  close to these beautiful and strange artworks, and to hear the artist  discuss his inspirations, working methods, and how the scrolls have  stayed with him for more than four decades.
