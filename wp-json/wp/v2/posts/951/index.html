Join us in the historic Los Angeles Athletic Club, where Raymond Chandler, then a young oil executive, played bridge and eavesdropped on the powerful men who would shape the city and his detective fiction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to understand Los Angeles literature out of context of the place. In the 1920s and 1930s, L.A. was bursting at the seams, as one of the biggest boom towns the world had ever seen. And as the city grew, it attracted a varied and fascinating population: East coast intellectuals, filmmakers, European refugees, hustlers and visionaries of all stripes.<\/p>\n<p>In this young city without an established cultural scene, the intelligentsia congregated in book shops, each with its own personality shaped by the book seller who curated the selection and the space. In the Salon series, we celebrate the forgotten history of L.A. book culture, from Hollywood Boulevard to downtown\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bookseller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Row, in an original presentation by Howard Prouty. Each book shop\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story illuminates the literary life of the city, and the emotional growth of the writers who called Los Angeles home.&nbsp;(Please note, Howard Prouty will not be presenting at the April 2013 Salon)<\/p>\n<p>Past Salons have celebrated the life and work of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/mussosalon1\" target=\"_blank\">John Fante<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/mussosalon2\" target=\"_blank\">Raymond Chandler<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/tullysalon2012\">Jim Tully<\/a>,&nbsp;<a style=\"font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12.222222328186035px; font-style: normal; line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/mussosalon3\" target=\"_blank\">F.
