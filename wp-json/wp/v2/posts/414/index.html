This hilarious and exciting Dada-documentary follows the evolution of the prankish group from its origins in the San Francisco Suicide Club through the creation of the Burning Man Festival, the irreverent <a href=\"http:\/\/la.cacophony.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Los Angeles Cacophony Society<\/a> and beyond. This is the history of a significant American underground cultural movement, featuring astonishing footage never before seen by normal people. The Cacophony Society is a national network of creative provocateurs serving as prototype for Chuck Palahniuk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s &#8220;Fight Club.&#8221; &nbsp;Throughout the 1990s, the Society&#8217;s notorious Los Angeles lodge orchestrated hundreds of darkly absurdist culture-jamming spectacles ranging from the detonation of a pyro-charged 80-foot replica of Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Small World ride to a Christmas face-off between a two-hundred-strong mob of Santas and a riot squad.

Al will also be talking about his current project, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.artofbleeding.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Bleeding<\/a>, a performance collective that gathers together a number of former LA Cacophonists for absurdist medically-themed stage shows and events. The Art of Bleeding produces ego-destabilizing programs on safety and medical education for both live and video presentation. Often staged from an actual ambulance, their performances utilize a perturbing mix of cartoonish costumes, puppets, vintage educational films, animation, and thinly veiled medical fetishism to create a sort of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153paramedical funhouse\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in which the groping ego may ultimately experience TRUE SAFETY CONSCIOUSNESS. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<div>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2From his music-biz research archives, LAVA Visionary <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/user\/55\" target=\"_blank\">Gene Sculatti<\/a> presents TALES FROM THE FLIPSIDE, a recounting of some of the more colorful and outrageous scams, tricks and stunts used by promotion men to get their records played.
