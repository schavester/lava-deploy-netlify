Since it entered history, the dream of California has been that it is a place of plenty, of potential, of personal opportunity. The orange became a glowing symbol of this dream. <a title=\"David Boule\" href=\"http:\/\/www.angelcitypress.com\/collections\/authors-david-boule\" target=\"_blank\">David Boul\u00c3\u00a9<\/a>, author of the recently released <a title=\"Orange &amp; the California Dream\" href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/1883318629\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Orange and the Dream of California<\/em><\/a> (Angel City Press), will take a lively, literary and extraordinarily visual look at this colorful and captivating history and reveal the tremendous impact of the orange on the culture and development of California, and how these two entities have built on one another to feed the imagination and conjure a compelling fantasy.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;\">A third generation Californian, David has a lifelong fascination with the history, culture, achievements and uniqueness of the region. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The enduring image of California as paradise and the orange as unique among all fruit is because, partially, these things are true.
