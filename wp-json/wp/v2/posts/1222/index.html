The unfolding of this narrative doubles as Marc&#8217;s personal narrative of research, through false leads, dead ends, misinterpretations and out of the blue miracles, until by uncovering the untold story of James Oviatt, Marc Chevalier discovers his own voice, that of a major historian of lost Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p>Why look to James Oviatt, seller of upscale fashion, early proponent of the Art Deco, Machiavellian schemer and dreamer? Oviatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arc is a microcosm of the upwardly mobile in Jazz Age Los Angeles, and his story touches almost every major aspect of culture and commerce in pre-war Los Angeles. His influence is still felt on the city he left behind, and in the worlds of fashion, design, marketing and architecture.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><object width=\"560\" height=\"315\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/VD34RHEpwqE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" \/><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><\/object><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.818181991577148px; line-height: 1.5;\">For more about the January Salon, click <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 11.818181991577148px; line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/salon114\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1222\" data-postid=\"1222\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1222 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On the last Sunday of each month , LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles (noon-2pm), for a loosely structured conversational Salon featuring short presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.
