For this program, launching in January&nbsp;2013, we will designate an individual within the <a title=\"LAVA Visionaries\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/visionaries\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span> Visionaries<\/a>&nbsp;community who has, through their social finesse, community building and exploratory spirit, best exemplified the spirit of <span class=\"caps\">LAVA in the prior year<\/span>. The Visionary of the Year is an ambassador of goodwill representing the best of what an Angeleno can aspire to. We launch this annual award both to honor one remarkable Angeleno, and to remind all members of the extended <span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span> community to look to their higher selves and aspire to be their best&#8211;today and always.<\/p>\n<p>The 2013 <span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span> Visionary of the Year Award will be presented to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/user\/1765\">Dwain Carlo Crum<\/a>. Dwain is a regular attendee at <span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span> events, and his red cap and good cheer have become rocks upon which we have built our community. As a <span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span> Visionary, he has hosted the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/savannah\">2012 Memorial Day tour of Savannah Memorial Cemetery<\/a>, an entity for which he serves as Executive Director.    Among Dwain&#8217;s passions are traveling the country in his motor home The Black Pearl, collecting matchbook covers and swizzle sticks, organizing social gatherings for fellow retired academics in the San Gabriel Valley, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_details_lists?userid=wm97KC6G0resSDXTmNIMKw\" target=\"_blank\">appearing<\/a> as an extra in motion pictures, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_details?userid=wm97KC6G0resSDXTmNIMKw\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing<\/a> businesses on Yelp (even though the website, apparently unable to handle someone with Dwain&#8217;s passion and energy, has blocked all 500+ of his reviews from regular viewing).*<\/p>\n<p>Dwain is larger-than-life, all-embracing, accommodating and gracious, and an exemplar of the spirit of LAVA. Please join us as we celebrate him on the eve of his departure on a seven-month round-the-world cruise. We will miss him in Los Angeles, but know that many new friends will be grateful for his presence out on the high seas and varied ports o&#8217; call.<\/p>\n<p>There will be no-host cocktails from 6:30pm to 8pm in the bar of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, followed by the presentation of the award at 8pm. The event is free, but reservations are required, and drinks or food not included.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-style: normal; font-size: 12.222222328186035px; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\">*Please&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact<\/a>&nbsp;Yelp asking that they liberate Dwain &#8220;The Pirate&#8221; C&#8217;s hidden&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_details?userid=wm97KC6G0resSDXTmNIMKw\" target=\"_blank\">reviews<\/a>&nbsp;and make them available for public viewing. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-911\" data-postid=\"911\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-911 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To sign up for this free event: First register as a user on this site, and then return to this page.
