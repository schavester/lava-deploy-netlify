Prof. Raymond will provide an overview of Forensic Engineering with a focus on his specialty, <a href=\"http:\/\/web.calstatela.edu\/programs\/biomechlab\/\" target=\"_blank\">Forensic Injury Biomechanics<\/a>. The presentation will introduce attendees to the field of forensic engineering and subspecialties; including injury biomechanics. Dr. Raymond will provide some historical background on the genesis of this field along with modern applications of injury biomechanics in engineering design and in forensic applications. Finally Dr. Raymond will demonstrate the utility of biomechanics in forensic science through the presentation of real-world cases.<\/p>\n<p>For the second presentation, <span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span> crime lab host Prof. Donald Johnson will provide an overview of Blood Stain Patterning through his long working relationship with Dr. Raymond.<\/p>\n<p>The first topic covered will be the development of an <a href=\"http:\/\/narrative.ly\/unsolved-mysteries\/the-sultan-of-spatter\/\" target=\"_blank\">Automated Imaging System for Blood Stain Patterning<\/a>, demonstrating their work in producing more sophisticated mathematical models\u00e2\u20ac\u201drecognizing that trajectories are arcs, not straight lines, for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201d leading up to a means by which wound origin and trajectories can be quickly processed by forensic investigators at crime scenes. Numerous real-life case examples will be used to illustrate this discussion.<\/p>\n<p>Next Prof. Johnson will discuss their work on <a target=\"_blank\">micro <span class=\"caps\">RNA<\/span>,<\/a> which is leading to determination of wound of origin for blood stains. Using the 1990s-era <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk\/2006\/feb\/10\/ukcrime.sandralaville\" target=\"_blank\">British murder case<\/a> against <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Billie-Jo_Jenkins\" target=\"_blank\">Sion Jenkins<\/a> as a jumping off point, Prof. Johnson will explain the methodology and instruments by which his graduate students are learning how to pinpoint proteins in <span class=\"caps\">RNA<\/span> specific to respective organs and account for them in blood stain patterns.<\/p>\n<p>By proving the wound of origin for blood evidence, forensic scientists can discount the claims of suspects who insist a victim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blood at a crime scene got there by innocent means (nose bleed, minor accidental injury, etc.). Using the new analytical methods developed in Prof. Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lab, a scientist can prove that the blood stain in question originated with bleeding from the lungs, and not from the mucus membrane in the victim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nasal passage.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1228\" data-postid=\"1228\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1228 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To purchase a ticket for this special event, click here.&nbsp;If you&#8217;d like to be contacted when another crime lab tour and lecture are scheduled, subscribe to LAVA&#8217;s occasional Crime Lab Newsletter.
