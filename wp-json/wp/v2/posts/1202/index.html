The issues faced by the county\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership in the form of the Board of Supervisors had a profound effect on the economy and quality of life in what would become the most populous county in the nation. Many of these challenges, as examined in Tom Sitton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book <a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/0914421336\"><em>The Courthouse Crowd: Los Angeles County and its Government, 1850-1950<\/em><\/a> would persist in the post-World War II era and are still apparent today. In his presentation, author Tom Sitton will discuss a few of these issues and some of the increasingly powerful Supervisors who faced them, share a colorful &#8220;rogues&#8217; gallery&#8221; of some of the most corrupt politicians in the region&#8217;s history, and describe how the book was written.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Presentation Two<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A joint presentation centered around <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thekeptgirl.com\/p\/the-kept-girl.html\"><em>The Kept Girl<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;(<em>Esotouric Ink, 2014)<\/em>, <span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span> co-founder Kim Cooper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s novel of 1929 Los Angeles starring the young Raymond Chandler, his devoted secretary and the real-life cop who is a likely model for Philip Marlowe.
