We will also be looking at the historic streetscape, with attention paid to street lights, sidewalks (terrazzo in particular), basement hatches, sidewalk vents, glass blocks, manhole covers, granite curbs and signage.<\/p>\n<p><em>Motivation for this tour series<\/em>:<\/p>\n<p>With City Council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s June 2013 approval of <a href=\"http:\/\/blogdowntown.com\/2013\/07\/7228-broadway-to-trade-in-traffic-lanes-for-pedestrian\">funding<\/a> for Strategy One, Phase One of the Broadway Streetscape Master Plan, we believe that it is it is imperative to develop a greater public awareness and understanding of Broadway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s architectural and scenic qualities, and to bring the informed voices of the community into discussion of the proposed changes and alterations. We believe that no element of Broadway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s streetscape can be altered without causing a transformation of the whole, requiring careful consideration before any permanent or semi-permanent changes are made. Broadway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s architectural character is defined not by any single feature (uniform height limits, predominance of theaters) or single landmark building (Eastern Columbia, Bradbury Building, Los Angeles Theater), but upon the concord of all of it, and the strength of the impression which all together they provide. No feature or building is of dominant importance, but each contributes, and all are vitally fused together into our National Register landmark district. Many of the salient architectural and streetscape features which will be the focus of this tour series are proposed to be impacted by the yet-unfunded Strategy One, Phase Two of the Broadway Streetscape Master Plan. The evolving situation demands public input and public awareness. We hope that you will join us on the tour series to better understand Broadway and become an advocate for its continued preservation, stewardship and vibrancy.<\/p>\n<p><em>About This Month&#8217;s Tour<\/em>:<\/p>\n<p>Tour guide is&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/esotouric.com\/richardschave\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Schave<\/a>&nbsp;(Esotouric\/LAVA).
