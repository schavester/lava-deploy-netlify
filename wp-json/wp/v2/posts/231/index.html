In addition to its place in Southern California&#8217;s car culture, it is also said to have been (over the decades) a brothel, a speak-easy, a gambling den, a mobster hangout, and a half-way house. The management has agreed to give attendees tours of haunted room 120, where an actress (or possibly a prostitute) died when her head cracked open on the radiator during the throws of passion.&nbsp; In addition, there will be themed live entertainment in the bar, and some other spooky surprises.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-231\" data-postid=\"231\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-231 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>GHOULA meets for cocktails in haunted places on the 13th of each month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SPIRITS with SPIRITS\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is a casual gathering of regional ghost hunters and those that just like ghost stories.
