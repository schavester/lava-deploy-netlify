That moment has arrived. On the EAST SIDE BABYLON tour you&#8217;ll discover fascinating, little-known neighborhoods and the grim memories they hold. Come visit Boyle Heights, where the Night Stalker was captured and a mad dad ran amok. Roam the hallowed lawns of Evergreen, L.A.&#8217;s oldest cemetery and home of some memorable haunts and strange burials. Visit East Los Angeles, where a deranged radio shop employee made mince meat of his boss and bride&#8211;and you can get your hair done in a building shaped like a giant tamale. Explore the ghastly streets of Commerce, where one small neighborhood&#8217;s myriad crimes will shock and surprise. Visit Montebello, for scrumptious milk and cookies at Broguiere&#8217;s Farm Fresh Dairy washed down with a horrifying case of child murder. All this, and so much more on EAST SIDE BABYLON, Esotouric&#8217;s exploration of L.A.&#8217;s most horrifying forgotten crimes.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1093\" data-postid=\"1093\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1093 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Go East, Young Crime Fiend!
