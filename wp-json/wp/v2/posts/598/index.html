He does this by determining the actual \u00e2\u20ac\u0153target\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the arson attack and the method of ignition for the event. This usually indicates a motive and the level of sophistication of the offender. Because arson is a very personal crime in which the victim nearly always knows who set the fire, it is relatively easy to identify a suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u201dalthough proving they were involved is not so easy.<\/p>\n<p>LECTURE #2 focuses on select cases studies of convicted serial arsonists, including nationally known crimes and cases on which Ed Nordskog worked personally. Included will be discussion of Glendale arson investigator \/ arsonist <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Leonard_Orr\">John Orr<\/a> and the prolific Washington D.C. arsonist <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alternet.org\/story\/53378\/?page=entire\">Thomas Sweatt<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Following this second lecture, attendees will have the opportunity to purchase copies of Ed Nordskog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book \u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Torchered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Minds: Case Histories of Notorious Serial Arsonists.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p>By the afternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conclusion, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the real work that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done in the field by arson investigators, and the tools and techniques used to interpret crime scenes for the benefit of investigating officers and juries.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT ED NORDSKOG: Ed Nordskog is an active arson\/bomb detective with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department.
