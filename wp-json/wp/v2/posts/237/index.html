He became Louise Bourgeois&#8217; assistant in 1980. Two years later he launched a decade long career as the Graphics Producer for the ABC television network in NYC. Pioneering the use of on-air digital graphics, Gialanella won an Emmy in 1992.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">Sculpting with reclaimed materials for the last 15 years, the artist- living and working in Los Angeles &#8211; has a keen, searching intellect that constantly leads him to challenge his skills and method of expression. The result is a vast array of satirical, witty pieces that combine several metalworking techniques as well as elements of painting and assemblage.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">Although trained in the classic disciplines of bronze casting, carving and modeling in clay, he chooses instead to create sculpture from garbage. By using discarded objects he reinvents them with a greater purpose \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to function as art.&nbsp; With raw materials ranging from salvaged steel and discarded wood, to plastic objects from the landfill and surplus silverware Gialanella is a sort of modern day Dr. Frankenstein, breathing new life into what society has ignored.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoPlainText\">Gialanella is currently (May 2010) short listed as one of three finalists for the McBean Transit Center Public sculpture initiative in Santa Clarita, CA. In 2009 Gialanella was shortlisted for an international public sculpture competition in Perth, Australia and was featured in CTN Green Magazine.&nbsp; He is part of the Landfill Art Project Collection and is an active member of the New York Sculptors Guild.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-237\" data-postid=\"237\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-237 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Donald Gialanella received his BFA from the Cooper Union in 1979 studying with Jim Dine, Louise Bourgeois, Vito Acconci and Milton Glazer.
