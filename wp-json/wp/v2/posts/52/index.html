Since 1959, this mountain has also been considered holy by Members of the non-profit spiritual organization, The Aetherius Society, who recognize this sacred mountain as having been charged with Cosmic energies. Each summer since 1959, we have been visiting the mountain to send out powerful waves of spiritual energy to the world for World Peace and Global Healing through the action of selfless prayer. The first World Peace Pilgrimage was held in August 2009 to mark the 50th anniversary of the charging of this Holy Mountain. The event was&nbsp;one of just 60 &#8220;Pre-Parliament Events&#8221; around the world endorsed by the <a title=\"blocked::http:\/\/www.parliamentofreligions.org\/ http:\/\/www.parliamentofreligions.org\/\" href=\"http:\/\/www.parliamentofreligions.org\/\"><span style=\"color: #000bff;\"><span title=\"blocked::http:\/\/www.parliamentofreligions.org\/ http:\/\/www.parliamentofreligions.org\/\"><span title=\"blocked::http:\/\/www.parliamentofreligions.org\/ http:\/\/www.parliamentofreligions.org\/\"><span style=\"color: #000bff; text-decoration: none;\" title=\"blocked::http:\/\/www.parliamentofreligions.org\/\">Parliament of the World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Religions<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a>, the largest interfaith movement in the world, prior to their gathering in Melbourne, Australia in December, 2009. Over 200 people from various religious traditions, and no religious traditions, gathered on the mountain sending a wave of prayer energy to the world.
