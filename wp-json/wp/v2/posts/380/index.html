Fueled by immigration from Taiwan, Hong  Kong, more recently South East Asia, these communities have found their  identity, their economic base, and have come into their own as a new  type of American \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chinatown.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p>Hosted by Richard Schave, THE NEW CHINATOWNS is an entertaining and  illuminating historical and cultural bus tour that rolls through  Alhambra, San Gabriel, Rosemead and (mainly) Monterey Park exploring  significant people, remarkable places and delicious delicacies. Join us  as we explore the region&#8217;s fascinating history, from the land and oil  booms of the 1920s, its halcyon postwar days as a suburban outpost for  lower middle class Angelenos, the birthplace of the Hula Hoop (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wham-o.com\/\" target=\"new\">Wham-o Industries<\/a>),  to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153white flight\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of the 1970s which created the vacuum that  facilitated the first wave of migration from China. Among the  significant sites on our itinerary:<\/p>\n<p>* The Venice Room (Monterey Park), a groovy grill-your-own-steak bar, still family-run after forty years.<br \/> * Browning Realty (Monterey Park), site of the 1920s oil mania and still a family enterprise after eighty-plus years.<br \/> * El Encanto (Monterey Park), exquisite showplace of the failed 1920s  luxury housing development intended as the Beverly Hills of the East.<br \/> * Mission Superhardware (San Gabriel), still run by the Fabriano family  after more than seven decades, and previously where Howard Roach built  some of the Southland&#8217;s first television sets.<br \/> * Site of the original Laura Scudder potato chip factory (Monterey Park).<br \/> * Pioneering purveyors of high quality Asian herbs, teas and notions, Wing Hop Fung, for a  tea tasting.<\/p>\n<p>Today Monterey Park is at the crossroads of economic development.  After three decades spent fostering independent businesses-fueled by  immigrant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dreams and sweat, the city is looking to bring in big  business, which it claims is desperately needed for its tax base.  Can  this unique and quintessentially independent community survive another  identity crisis, another land boom, this time of a distinctly corporate  nature?<\/p>\n<p>Special attention will be paid in the route to a compelling side  effect of this sociological revolution: the best Asian food in the world  is here as well.  We will end the tour with a tea tasting at <a href=\"http:\/\/winghopfung.com\/\" target=\"new\">Wing Hop Fung<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This tour is just one on our <a href=\"http:\/\/esotouric.com\/reynerpage\">Reyner Banham Tour Series<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-380\" data-postid=\"380\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-380 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Esotouric presents: Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles: The New Chinatowns: San Gabriel Valley In the past three decades the communities of Alhambra and Monterey Park, nestled in the foothills of the southwestern San Gabriel Valley, have transformed themselves from sleepy suburban bedroom communities (bursting at the seams from a 1950s housing explosion) to the nexus [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","amp_status":"","spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[6,55,14,20,22,27],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p7lp7K-68","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/380"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=380"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/380\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=380"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=380"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=380"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
