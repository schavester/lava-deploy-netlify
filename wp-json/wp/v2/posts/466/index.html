The core notion of the&nbsp;series is of culture and history as commodities that are packaged and sold to a target demographic; meanwhile, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the ignored and seemingly worthless scraps of meaning found on the sidewalks and&nbsp;marketplaces where the true remnants of positive public space can be found. All interpretations and nuisances of the word fl\u00c3\u00a2neur are examined\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfrom the modern-day aesthete dreaming of Baudelaire while carried along in the human tide past the stalls and shops of Broadway, to its more recent and perhaps relevant use, someone who is loitering. At its heart this series is a celebration of the simple act of getting out of your car, walking through a neighborhood and learning to see it with your own eyes.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-466\" data-postid=\"466\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-466 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Update: Sorry, all spaces are now filled for the free walking tour, but anyone may attend the free Sunday Salon that precedes the tour (noon-2pm), and Nathan Marsak&#8217;s pre-walking-tour presentation (2pm+) on the architecture of &#8220;L.A.
