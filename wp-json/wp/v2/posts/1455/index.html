Rarely does a natural poet and historian such as Joan Jobe Smith endure such ordeals and challenges and survive to tell the tale. It is a Tale written with go-going panache and patois, and heart, courage and humor to make our lives richer and wiser. The event took the form of a series of short Q&amp;As with LAVA&#8217;s Richard Schave on milestones from the memoir and Joan&#8217;s relationship with the writer Charles Bukowski, punctuated by Joan reading poetry selections which span her career.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">For more on Joan Jobe Smith, visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pearlmag.com\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.pearlmag.com<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">To view, click <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VJJUeB4XL4Q&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">this link<\/a> or the image below.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/VJJUeB4XL4Q\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1455\" data-postid=\"1455\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1455 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On the last Sunday of each month, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles, for a structured Salon featuring formal presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.
