Each \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reinvention\u00e2\u20ac\u009d reveals distinct aspects of abiding social, political, environmental and economic change.<\/p>\n<p>Join LAVA for what we do best: pulling back the layers of history and providing context for the very old places in this very new city.  The living history docents of Rancho Los Cerritos will take us through the Rancho, the new interpretive center, and the gardens to give us a glimpse into the lives of people of Rancho Los Cerritos, and by extension other surrounding ranchos, whose ties of kin, and commerce are a strong and clear thread across these nearly two centuries and three changes in sovereignty.<\/p>\n<p>This three-hour event will break into three parts: a tour of the rancho and new interpretive center (90 miunutes), a talk by Rancho Los Cerritos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Executive Director Ellen Calomiris about her 22 years at the site (30 minutes), and a garden tour (30 minutes).<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-880\" data-postid=\"880\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-880 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To sign up for this free event: First register as a user on this site, and then return to this page.
