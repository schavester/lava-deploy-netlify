With love, GHOULA.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>But you can still join us at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/salon1010\" target=\"_blank\">Sunday Salon<\/a>, for an afternoon of free, spooky entertainments.&nbsp; <br \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Los Angeles Visionaries Association (LAVA) presents:<\/p>\n<p>THE GREAT MILLION DOLLAR GHOST HUNT<\/p>\n<p>A special event hosted by GHOULA (Ghost Hunters of Urban Los Angeles) and LAVA Visionary Nick Matonak immediately following the monthly Sunday Salon at Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria. To reserve, click <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/node\/338\/signups\" target=\"_blank\">this<\/a> link (reservations are good for one person only&#8211; each person in a group must sign up individually).<\/p>\n<p>Calling all ghost hunters, paranormal investigators, psychics, sensitives, and those interested in getting a glimpse of the &#8220;other side.&#8221; Whether you are acting alone, or in a team, GHOULA wants you! Whether you are a seasoned pro or this is your first ghost hunt, GHOULA wants you!<\/p>\n<p>If you are up for the challenge, come be a part of the biggest &#8220;ecto-experiment&#8221; ever attempted in Los Angeles (and possibly the world). <\/p>\n<p>On Halloween (Oct. 31st) @ 2:30pm, the doors to the historic, haunted Million Dollar Theater will open, and everyone will have exactly two and a half hours (til 5:00pm), to document anything &#8220;out of the ordinary.&#8221; From electro-magnetic anomalies to shivers down your spine, if you feel it, witness it, or record it, we want to hear about it, and we want to know exactly where it happened. So bring your EMF meters, your EVP recorders, your cameras, or just yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Each participant will receive their own individual map, which will be used to record the location of any &#8220;activity.&#8221; Please keep your info confidential until after the experiment, to discourage copy-cat contamination.The maps will then be returned at the end of the event to GHOULA, at which point the group will give a presentation on previously reported unexplained experiences in the theater. Based on everyone&#8217;s data, &#8220;hot spots&#8221; will be determined and posted online with the actual stories associated with this location&#8217;s ghost(s). Those that have devices that need time to be reviewed (i.e. digital recorders, infra-red video, etc.) will have one week (til Nov. 7) to report any additional &#8220;places of interest&#8221; to be included before our big reveal at GHOULA&#8217;s monthly &#8220;Spirits with Spirits&#8221; mixer. The results will be posted the next day @ http:\/\/www.ghoula.org.<\/p>\n<p>For this once in a lifetime opportunity to explore this haunted landmark with others from the paranormal community, a $5.00 donation is requested that will go to help preserve these amazing buildings for future generations to enjoy. This event will also be limited to the first 100 people interested, and the online guest list will be closed at 11am on Sunday, October 31.
