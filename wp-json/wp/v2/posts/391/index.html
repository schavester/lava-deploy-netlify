Sunday 9AM-5PM.<\/p>\n<p>Brummbaer has been infatuated with new 3D-fractal software, which is the basis of many of his latest paintings. In addition, to using the latest technology to achieve the new paintings, Brummbaer embraces the old school of layering paints and glazes on top of the fractal works of art. In the end the works are stunningly colorful and vibrant modern abstract paintings.<\/p>\n<p>He says creating and watching fractals is like observing the monumental battle between order and chaos unfolding in front of your eyes. Still while fractal images are usually exquisitely beautiful by themselves &#8212; they hardly ever move beyond &#8220;eyecandy&#8221;.Brummbaer&#8217;s painted fractals on the other hand are surprisingly romantic and display at times very emotional statements about living on this planet.<\/p>\n<p>Brummbaer is a German-American digital artist who has done work as an art director, film art director, designer, graphic artist, and 3-D modeler. His fine art and underground magazine Germania brought him recognition in Europe during the 1960s, and he orchestrated light shows for musicians such as Frank Zappa and Tangerine Dream. Due to his large and rare collection of underground comics, Brummbaer translated and edited Robert Crumb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first book in Germany. With the success of the book he was able start a comic-book-company &#8220;Brumm Comix.&#8221; In 1985 the International Synergy Institute in Los Angeles invited Brummbaer to be their artist in residence, and work on their Fairlight CVI computer. Brummbaer began focusing on computer graphics. He created several short computer-generated animations and has done visual effects for a number of popular films such as, The Craft (digital artist: butterfly sequence). Brummbaer was one of the primary computer animators responsible for the special effects in the Tristar motion picture Johnny Mnemonic. Brummbaer also created innovative openers for SIGGRAPH&#8217;s &#8220;Electronic Theater,&#8221; and has long been a pioneer in the world of digital animation, where he has been noted for his signature hallucinogenic style.<\/p>\n<p>In the autumn of 2003 Brummbaer was diagnosed with squamous head and neck cancer. During several months of chemo- and radiation-therapy he wrote a semibiographical novel &#8220;On the Street: DXM in 1964 Or My Best Friend Jesus&#8221;, which is currently being published in Germany. The squamous head and neck cancer has not returned, although now he is inflicted with bladder-cancer. Brummbaer recently completed his second book, &#8220;What&#8217;s So Wrong With Love and Peace&#8221; &#8212; 1965-67.<\/p>\n<p>Timothy Leary comments on Brummbaer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work: &#8220;And now, here comes Brummbaer to show us how to use the screen for interpersonal communication; how to embrace, fondle, cuddle, snuggle, enliven our brain-exchanges to the level of the high spiritual art of India, China, Tibet, Rome, Egypt, Venice, Berlin. He has sculpted digital pixels into tender, caressing mind inter-play things. It is always the artists who blueprint and design the spirit of a culture. The 21st Century is beginning to express itself in the shimmering electronic realities of these digital wizards.&#8221; Timothy Leary, Nov. 1990, Los Angeles<\/p>\n<p>Contact: Julie Rico \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 310-387-3395<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-391\" data-postid=\"391\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-391 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Stray Cat Caf\u00c3\u00a9 located at 500 S.
