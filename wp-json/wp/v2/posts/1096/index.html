Speakers include Lindsey Fitzharris, Wellcome Trust Postdoctoral Research Fellow and host of the upcoming documentary Medicine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dark Secrets; Paul Koudounaris, Author of The Empire of Death and Heavenly Bodies, two books exploring Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s catacombs and ossuaries with lavish photographs; Jeff Jorgenson, owner of Elemental Cremation &amp; Burial and advocate for green death practices; Bess Lovejoy, author of Rest in Pieces: The Curious Fates of Famous Corpses; Sarah ElizabethTroop, host of The Cabinet of Curiosities Podcast, Joy Nash, Los Angeles-based actor, and Christine Colby, managing editor of Penthouse.<\/p>\n<p>Musical performances by Mutter Museum artist grant recipient Jill Tracy and Death Gospel troubadour Adam Arcuragi will round out an evening where you can learn some dark history, pick up macabre wares from local artisans, or grab the Grim Reaper for a photo op.
