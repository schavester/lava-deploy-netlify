The concept of Grace sees salvation and the Messiah (rapture) as imminent and tangible. Karma is predicated on reincarnation, the cycle of many, many lives lived through selflessness and right action as the soul strives to achieve release. These two notions, while irreconcilable, both inspire real and profound relationships with God in Los Angeles, from the church basements where believers speak in tongues, or in brightly light congregation rooms praying over gigantic crystals. Join Maja as we explore tantric Vedic practices, the Pentecostal rapture, the channeled Venusian stylings of an alien entity and other fascinating paths to salvation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; font-family: Arial, Geneva, Webdings, sans-serif; margin: 0px;\"><strong>TOUR LOCATIONS<\/strong>:&nbsp;<em>The Aetherius Society<\/em>.

Recently restored, the Parsonage is now a museum of her life and work, which to this day contains to ring clear to millions of believers worldwide.&nbsp;<em>The Vedanta Society of Southern California<\/em>.
