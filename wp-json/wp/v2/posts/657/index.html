The <a href=\"http:\/\/digitallibrary.usc.edu\/assetserver\/controller\/view\/search\/CHS-13060\">Rancho<\/a> encompassed 75,000 acres and included what would become the Los Angeles harbor. In 1826, Juan Jose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heir Manuel Dominguez constructed the Dominguez Rancho Adobe as it is seen today.<\/p>\n<p>The reconstructed environments throughout the adobe focus on what life was like in Los Angeles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 poorly understood <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ranchos_of_California\">Rancho era<\/a>, which lasted roughly from the 1833 secularization of Mission lands through California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Statehood (1850) and ending with the disastrous droughts and floods of the 1860s.  Out of the failure of this fascinating agrarian culture and the subsequent rise of industrialization, the agricultural economy which carried the region into the 20th Century was born.<\/p>\n<p>The museum also has an extensive collection on the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1910_Los_Angeles_International_Air_Meet_at_Dominguez_Field\">Dominguez Hills Air Meet<\/a> and its role in early Los Angeles aviation history and industry, including a miniature table-top model of dirigibles and planes featured at the 1910 Air Meet that was constructed by Paramount Studios artisans.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PARKING:&nbsp;<\/strong>Upon entering the grounds there is a large concrete pad on your left.
