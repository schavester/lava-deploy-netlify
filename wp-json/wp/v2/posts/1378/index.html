In addition to his seven previous books on No\u00c3\u00abl Coward, he has written about Dorothy Parker, Oscar Wilde, Johnny Mercer, and Rodgers &amp; Hart. Day was awarded the <span class=\"caps\">OBE<\/span> (Order of the British Empire) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for services to British culture in the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">ABOUT<\/span> <span class=\"caps\">THE<\/span> <span class=\"caps\">NEW<\/span> <span class=\"caps\">BOOK<\/span>: Raymond Chandler never wrote a memoir or autobiography. The closest he came to writing either was in\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand around\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhis novels, shorts stories, and letters. There have been books that describe and evaluate Chandler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life, but to find out what he himself felt about his life and work, Barry Day, editor of <em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/0307391000\" target=\"_blank\">The Letters of No\u00c3\u00abl Coward<\/a><\/em> (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is much to dazzle here in just the way we expect&#8230; &nbsp;the book is meticulous, artfully structured\u00e2\u20ac\u201dsplendid\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201dDaniel Mendelsohn; <em>The New York Review of Books<\/em>), has cannily, deftly chosen from Chandler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s writing, as well as the many interviews he gave over the years as he achieved cult status, to weave together an illuminating narrative that reveals the man, the work, the worlds he created. Using Chandler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own words as well as Day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s text, here is the life of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the man with no home,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d a man precariously balanced between his classical English education with its immutable values and that of a fast-evolving America during the years before the Great War, and the changing vernacular of the cultural psyche that resulted. Chandler makes clear what it is to be a writer, and in particular what it is to be a writer of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hardboiled\u00e2\u20ac\u009d fiction in what was for him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another language.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Along the way, he discusses the work of his contemporaries: Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Agatha Christie, W. Somerset Maugham, and others (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wish,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said Chandler, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I had one of those facile plotting brains, like Erle Gardner\u00e2\u20ac\u009d).<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1378\" data-postid=\"1378\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1378 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To sign up for this free event: First register as a user on this site, and then return to this page.
