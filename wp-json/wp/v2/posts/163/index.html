The gallery&#8217;s space is beautiful, spacious, open air, and DANCING is not only allowed, it is encouraged!!!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The return of Samba Society earlier this year was quite an event. The vibrant K\u00c3\u00a1tia Moraes and the exceptional guitarist Mitchell Long joined us onstage as special guests but are now permanent Samba Society Fellows! We will be bringing to you our 11-piece band, with full vocal harmonies, swinging percussion rhythm section, plus the traditional sounds of the 7-string guitar and the cavaco.<\/p>\n<p>Samba Society will play a repertoire of vintage sambas, B-sides, and arrangements of classics primarily from the 1960s and 70s. We will feature songs by composers of the &#8220;Old Guard&#8221; of samba that have been largely ignored by mainstream media and are little known outside of Rio, even to Brazilians.<\/p>\n<p>The cover charge is a modest $5 to support the professional musicians.
