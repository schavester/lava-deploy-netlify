LAVA member Laura Brody and Heidi Dakter want to create a circus parade by live draping the local ringmaster and clowns from Circus World and the people of the town in old circus materials and making them into the parade. They&#8217;ve got workshops planned for creating memory boxes out of old memorabilia (Heidi) and making your own garments from old materials (Laura) and gallery shows from great local sources- the old circus costumes of Circus World and from American Players Theater, plus the whimsical metal creatures of Dr. Evermor and his Forevertron.<\/p>\n<p>The Kickstarter project just went up &#8211; and the deadline is Sunday, June 5th at 6:46 PST.<\/p>\n<p>Please come and see the project on Kickstarter, share the link and be inspired to fund your own dreams!
