The readings will explore the themes of this genre: crime, decay, anonymity, hauntings from the past and a palpable sense of place and feel unique to Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Presentation Two:&nbsp;<\/strong>Architectural historian <a href=\"http:\/\/www.insroland.org\/user\/653\" target=\"_blank\">Nathan Marsak<\/a>, author of <em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/0764315420\" target=\"_blank\">Los Angeles Neon<\/a><\/em>, will present on Los Angeles&#8217;s great public mausolea.  In this cultural and architectural history of how Los Angeles came to understand the community mausoleum, Marsak will chart the southland&#8217;s parallels with and digressions from America&#8217;s developing mores and attitudes toward the space of death.<\/p>\n<p>Emerging from the early 20th-century Garden Cemetery movement, Los Angeles not only contributed the concept of the memorial park, but also many of the finest&#8211;and sometimes strangest&#8211;grand public mausolea known. Los Angeles, long noted for its mimetic &#8220;California Crazy&#8221; and futuristic Googie architecture, needed, in its funerary architecture, to strive for solemnity and sublimity.&nbsp; Nevertheless, its cemetery buildings betray a peculiar and genuinely Southern Californian ethos in their expression.<\/p>\n<p>Discussed will be the 1903 Chapel of the Pines crematory and columbarium; the early community mausolea of the &#8216;teens; the interbellum wonders of Forest Lawn&#8217;s neogothic Great Mausoleum, Angeles Abbey&#8217;s Arabian wonderland, and early-Christian meets Art Deco at Calvary Cemetery. Particular study will be given to the postwar era and the specific challenges mausoleum design faced adapting to Modernism&#8211;it is during this period they are routinely disparaged as filing cabinet necro-tenements&#8211;and how new considerations of population and land management influenced the building of open garden-court mausolea and columbaria. <\/p>\n<p>Their legacy has left us with a means to gauge the city&#8217;s development (as well as remarkable tile work and stained glass).&nbsp; Through this lens, Marsak will reveal this significant, yet little-valued aspect of our architectural landscape.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1211\" data-postid=\"1211\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1211 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Join&nbsp;LAVA&nbsp;for our revived free monthly Sunday Salon series.
