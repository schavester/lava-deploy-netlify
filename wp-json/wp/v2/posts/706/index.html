At the age of 20 he followed his sister to the United States, emigrating and seeking to make this his permanent home.<\/p>\n<p>During the Vietnam conflict he was drafted into the army and because of his background was assigned to the Corps of Engineers. His brush with death there was for him a sign that he had to pursue his dream as an artist. He signed up for art classes at Los Angeles City College, particularly enjoying his friendship with Raoul De la Sota, who at that time was teaching a painting class. He transferred to Cal State Northridge while working as a house painter. Soon after that he became a naturalized citizen.<\/p>\n<p>He had always been aware of the work of the Japanese artist and printmaker, Hokusai, whose art spanned the 18th and 19th centuries, but never before had he seen him as a parallel to his own dreams of being an artist. Hokusai had been a revolutionary artist breaking so many aesthetic traditions with his work that collectors of his work often hid Hokusai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work among their collections because of his rebellion against the established norms. Katsu saw him as a symbol of an artist true to his calling and thus about ten years ago began his subtle updating of the \u00e2\u20ac\u015336 Views of Mount Fuji,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the classic work of Hokusai. He admits that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I learned almost all my sense of patience by doing those challenging works.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Katsu continues to see his work as always working from nature, just as Hokusai would always work from forms in his homeland.<\/p>\n<p>After the opening, the exhibit is open by appointment until July 6.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-706\" data-postid=\"706\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-706 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Katsu Yokoyama was born in Tokyo, Japan and had his early schooling in his home country desiring always to be an artist but eventually working in drafting and architecture since he was dissuaded by others from living an impoverished life of an artist.
