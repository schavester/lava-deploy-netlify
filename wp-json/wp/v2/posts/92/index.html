P. Blavatsky (&#8220;Collected Writings, Volume VI&#8221; \/ The Theosophist, Vol. V, #9, June 1884)<\/p>\n<p>Madame Blavatsky was one of esoteric scholar Manly P. Hall&#8217;s favorite historical figures, and all of her writings are lovingly collected in his library at the Philosophical Research Society in Los Feliz.  They are housed next to to the extensive Astrology section.  In addition to his many books and lectures, one of Hall&#8217;s lesser-known accomplishments was writing the story for a major Hollywood motion picture whose theme was murder and astrology. The subject is no surprise, coming from the mind of the Los Angeles Philosopher who collected hundreds of charts examining astrological connections to the deaths of celebrities.<\/p>\n<p><em>When Were You Born<\/em> (1938) examines the validity and effectiveness of Astrology as a means of psychological profiling and to provide forensic evidence of crime.  The film was directed by William C. McGann and stars Anna May Wong, Lola Lane and James Stephenson, with an appearance by a young Clayton &#8220;Lone Ranger&#8221; Moore as the D.A.&#8217;s Assistant.<\/p>\n<p>This free screening is hosted by the United Lodge of Theosophy in association with LAVA, the Los Angeles Visionaries Association, and presented by Maja D&#8217;Aoust, librarian at the Philosophical Research Society. After the screening, Maja will lead a discussion of the film&#8217;s themes and their relevance to Madame Blavatsky&#8217;s work.  The United Lodge of Theosophy in Los Angeles celebrated its 100 year anniversary in 2009, and has been in its current location since 1927. All are welcome to attend its classes without charge. This Lodge&#8217;s policy is &#8220;independent devotion to the cause of Theosophy without professing attachment to any Theosophical organization. It is loyal to the great Founders of the Theosophical Movement, but does not concern itself with dissensions or differences of individual opinion. The work it has on hand and the end it keeps in view are too absorbing and too lofty to leave it the time or inclination to take part in side issues. That work and that end is the dissemination of the fundamental principles of the Philosophy of Theosophy, and the exemplification in practice of those principles, through a truer realization of the SELF; a profounder conviction of Universal Brotherhood.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-92\" data-postid=\"92\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-92 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;True Astrology is a mathematical science, which teaches us what particular causes will produce what particular combinations, and thus, understood in its real significance, gives us the means of obtaining the knowledge how to guide our future births.&#8221; -H.
