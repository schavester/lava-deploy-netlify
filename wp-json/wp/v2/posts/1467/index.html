Media coverage of the subsequent trial exposed the thriving trade in sin along the Sunset Strip, and had southland husbands quaking in their socks. But the papers never printed the name of one prostitute arrested in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House of Francis\u00e2\u20ac\u009d raid: LaVonne Weaver, soon-to-be wife of gang kingpin Mickey Cohen. For decades, mob historians have chased down rumors that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dance instructor\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Lavonne was actually a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working girl.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Wonder no more, as in a <span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span> exclusive, LaVonne Weaver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mugshot will be unveiled. Lee Francis had a reputation, but madam Brenda Allen was an underworld superstar, as famous for her wardrobe and high-powered social connections as she was for the services available at her hillside brothel. Her 1948 arrest and subsequent Grand Jury investigation revealed deep veins of corruption within the Los Angeles Police Department.<\/p>\n<h3>Presentation #2: Beverly Hills Confidential<\/h3>\n<p>Clark Fogg, the lead forensics investigator at the Beverly Hills Police Department, and investigative journalist Barbara Schroeder share the sensational crimes and scandals of the glamorous city of Beverly Hills, as chronicled in their book \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beverly Hills Confidential: A Century of Stars, Scandals and Murders.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p>Featured topics include:<\/p>\n<p>The city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first blockbuster scandal \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the Doheny murder mystery at Greystone Mansion \u00e2\u20ac\u201d New information on who really killed gangster Bugsy Siegel \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The true story of the death of Lupe Velez, the movie star known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Mexican Spitfire\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201d The mysterious execution of publicist-to-the-stars Ronni Chasen<\/p>\n<p>Copies of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beverly Hills Confidential\u00e2\u20ac\u009d will be available for purchase and signing during the event.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1467\" data-postid=\"1467\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1467 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To buy a ticket for this event click here.&nbsp;If you&#8217;d like to be contacted when another crime lab tour and lecture are scheduled, subscribe&nbsp;to LAVA&#8217;s occasional Crime Lab Newsletter.
