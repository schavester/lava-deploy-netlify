The elegant home, built in 1894 by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frederick_Roehrig\" target=\"new\">Frederick Roehrig<\/a>, is an early, important and little-known example of the Mission Revival style in Los Angeles county. It is also along with the George House, which is the oldest house in La Mirada, all that remains of the former Windemere Ranch development of Andrew McNally. (The <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Andrew_McNally_House\" target=\"new\">McNally home<\/a> in Altadena, also designed by Roehring just a few years later, is not open to the public.) The celebrated architect of the California Style,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wallace_Neff\" target=\"new\">Wallace Neff<\/a>,&nbsp;was born at the Windemere Ranch.<\/p>\n<p>The free tours of the two homes interiors and the grounds will be hosted by members of the La Mirada Historical Preservation Advisory Council. The restored Neff house serves as a snapshot of life on the Windemere Ranch in the early 20th century and a glimpse of Southern California boosterism at that time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Please note that this is a child-friendly event, with appropriate presentations for younger people.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-932\" data-postid=\"932\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-932 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To sign up for this free event: First register as a user on this site, and then return to this page.
