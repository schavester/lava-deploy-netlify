Her intimate arrangements of animal, vegetable and mineral continue the traditions of 17th and 18th century northern European masters.<\/p>\n<p>In direct contrast with her process, Timothy Sellers uses the traditional medium of oil painting to create pictures with a modern feel. Each painting depicts one or two boldly iconic fruits or vegetables.<\/p>\n<p>Allison Achauer and Timothy Sellers live in Highland Park. Many of the fruits, vegetables, bird nests and other objects are from their garden.<\/p>\n<p>Since this is quite close to Pi Day (March 14), pies will be in attendance.
