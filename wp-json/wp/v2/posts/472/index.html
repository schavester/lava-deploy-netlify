(If you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard about this great resource, check it out. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fabulous way to get project funding. Each donation level has great prizes attached, if the project doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come through no money goes out, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just an inspiring and fun way to get your information out into the world.)<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The project is a Re-purposed Circus in Baraboo, WI (Circus City, USA). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the birthplace of the American circus and former home of the Ringling Brothers, now home to Circus World Museum.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Heidi Dakter and I were asked to create performances and workshops for the Summerset Festival of the Arts in Baraboo, Wisconsin. Heidi came from there, I have friends there and we were thrilled. We came up with a repurposed circus parade, using my live draping to transform old circus materials onto the townspeople and the lead clowns and ringmaster from Circus World. Heidi has created a series of memory boxes incorporating old materials and memorabilia into little dioramas, I make garments on live bodies by stapling old fabrics into new garments- it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a perfect combination for making repurposed arts workshops.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We put together ideas for 2 gallery shows from local sources: the fabulous collection of old circus costumes of Circus World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Museum, pieces from the renowned American Player\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Theater and Dr. Evermore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beautifully odd salvaged mechanical creatures. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a local artist who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s created stunning creatures out of old machinery, and while his work\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been featured as a roadside attraction he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much local attention. Sometimes it takes an outside perspective to get people to see what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in their own backyards\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Unfortunately, Wisconsin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been going through some difficulties with state funding (you may have heard about the protests) and while the Festival still wants us there, they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about spending the money to bring in outside talent.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">And this is where Kickstarter comes in! We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve contacted people and already started this process, and just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to let it lie. If we can possibly bring ourselves there, with the help of interested and fabulous folks\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Why not?<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Thanks so much, thanks to Kim and Richard and merry spring!<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Laura<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Links!
