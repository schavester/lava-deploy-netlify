Among the thousands of artifacts found at the site are bits of pottery, the foundation of an adobe structure, shells, beads, remnants of animal bones, 19<sup>th<\/sup> century railroad spikes and a Spanish silver coin dated 1816.

The tour occurs on Main Street, alongside the train tracks, opposite the San Gabriel Mission.
