Sennett, mythologically famous for his Keystone Cops, pies in the face, the discovery of film giants Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson, also had a very important and direct influence on the growth and development of Los Angeles during the 1910s and 1920s. Brent&#8217;s presentation will bring a fascinating Angeleno, his city and time, to life.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span><span><span>Presentation Two:<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ga.lsu.edu\/delyser\/delyserhome.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dydia DeLyser<\/a>&nbsp;presents&nbsp;<em>Take Nothing for Granted: The search for the first neon sign in America, and research in the era of the Internet<\/em> (co-authored with<em>&nbsp;<\/em>Paul Greenstein).&nbsp;Internet and published sources alike all describe, as the first neon sign in America, a 1923 sign saying &#8220;Packard,&#8221; erected for Earle C. Anthony, Inc., a prominent Packard dealer, on the corner of 7th and Flower Streets in downtown Los Angeles. But no one has ever provided a photograph of the sign in its original location, or referenced a primary source to support this claim. This presentation details Dydia and Paul&#8217;s search for the sign, and shows how their painstaking archival research proved every other source wrong.<\/p>\n<p>The salon will end and be followed <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 17.77777862548828px; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;\">immediately<\/span><em style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 17.77777862548828px; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;\"> <\/em>by a <a title=\"The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway Master Streetscape Walking Tour #1\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/flaneur-broadway-master1\" target=\"_blank\">free walking tour<\/a> of South Broadway.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1037\" data-postid=\"1037\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1037 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Join&nbsp;LAVA&nbsp;for our revived free monthly Sunday Salon series.
