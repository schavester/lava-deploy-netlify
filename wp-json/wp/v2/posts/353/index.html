Nancy wrote the following poem as her reasons for helping cats. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Power of Love\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve always thought that if we could actually feel the pain we cause others, most of us would cause much less pain. And we would work to end suffering worldwide, whether human or animal.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it! If your pain literally becomes mine, I want you out of pain so that I am freed, as well.<\/p>\n<p>With such empathy&#8211;a word that means &#8220;to feel within&#8221;&#8211;we would trod more gently on this Earth and do less damage overall.<\/p>\n<p>When leaders have empathy, the world will be ruled with great compassion.<\/p>\n<p>When individuals have empathy, the entire planet will be transformed by love.<\/p>\n<p>(Copyright Nancy Love~~All Rights Reserved)<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-353\" data-postid=\"353\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-353 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Purrrrrr\u00e2\u20ac\u009d&nbsp; A Benefit for Cats&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday, November 7 thru Saturday, January 8, 2011Opening for the Artists-Artwalk night Thursday, November 11, 2010 6-11pm The Stray Cat Caf\u00c3\u00a9 located at 500 S.
