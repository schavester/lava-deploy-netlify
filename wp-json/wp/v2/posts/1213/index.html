His art includes a run for public office in the 1978 California gubernatorial election, when his primary challenge to Governor Jerry Brown received some 62,000 votes. He is the creator of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fat City School of Finds Art,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d an unaccredited institution that grants free Masters and PhD degrees to arts students.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, 32 years after their last election faceoff, Darling once again challenged Jerry Brown in the race for governor. He has described that 2010 run as a means to raise awareness about California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s requirement of a two-thirds majority to pass a budget or tax.<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I use myself to make my art. I guess I am the art, though I hate the corniness of that idea and have always sort of fought against the little movements art critics give us. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been called a conceptual artist, a video artist, a performance artist, a media artist, a correspondence artist you name it, even a ceramist for Christ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sake. I think I may have even started a few. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always been only Lowell Darling. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a member of anything. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m simply just another lousy human body with a lot of ideas trying to escape.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After the opening, the exhibition is on view by appointment to April 4.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1213\" data-postid=\"1213\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1213 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Future Studio Gallery is super happy to host a show of Mr. Darling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent drawings, and maybe a few early pieces.
