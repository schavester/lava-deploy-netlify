Turning the West Side-centric notion of an L.A. architecture tour  on its head\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust like Banham&#8217;s book did for the historical monograph \u00e2\u20ac\u201c  the bus goes into areas not traditionally associated with the important,  beautiful or significant, raising issues of preservation, adaptive  reuse and the evolution of the city. The locations all speak to the  power, mutability and reach of the Southern California Dream. Some of  the tour stops are:<\/p>\n<p>Rancho San Antonio (1808). One of the oldest adobe structure in Los  Angeles County, it was built by the Lugo family, whose rancho spread all  the way to South Gate&#8211;the south gate of the property.  This  fascinating home sits smack dab in the middle of a 65-year-old trailer  park on the banks of the Rio Hondo River in Bell Gardens. Between the  layers of context at this site is the history of migration and growth in  the Southland, from Spanish land grants to the dust bowl to the vast  waves of stucco suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>The Clarke Estate (1920). A lost masterpiece by tilt-slab concrete  architect Irving Gill, this Mission Revival-inspired dwelling features  symbolic leaves pressed into the walls and feels like a time capsule  from a simpler California.<\/p>\n<p>Johnie&#8217;s Broiler (1958\/2008). A cautionary tale about historic  preservation, this beloved Downey diner with its landmark neon sign was  illegally demolished by a renter who wanted to park use cars in its  place. The site was barred from further commercial use due to public  outcry, and is now being restored as a Bob&#8217;s Big Boy.<\/p>\n<p>Tropicana Bakery. Downey&#8217;s most beloved Cuban sandwich and sweet  shop, creators of such temptations as the Choco-Flan, the giant  cake-and-fruit-filled Florentine cookie, and the Flan\/Cheesecake layer  cake.<\/p>\n<p>No other city has so fascinated architecture critics and scholars of  urban and cultural studies than L.A., that sprawling, self-referential  zone of mystery and glamour. British writer Reyner Banham was the first  to love Los Angeles for what she was, her ugliness as well as her  beauty. In the early 1970s he abandoned his academic preconceptions to  revel in this city of freeways, foothills, beaches and suburbs, built on  mobility and flux by a series of invaders. Along the way, he discovered  extraordinary spaces in neighborhoods that were often overlooked for  being too remote, too industrial, or simply occupying invisible &#8220;flyover  country&#8221; beneath the great L.A. freeways.<\/p>\n<p>In this city on the edge of the western dream, nothing was like what  came before. Status was no longer communicated through the construction  of stone palaces that looked like they fought every step of the journey  over the Rocky Mountains, but rather by freeway access and wacky  drive-thrus, light, ventilation, organic design and a sensitivity to a  built environment\u00e2\u20ac\u201d commercial and architectural innovations which would  have been unthinkable anywhere and anytime else.<\/p>\n<p>Gone was the unified vision of a city, and yet there  was a  method to L.A.&#8217;s madness.  What Banham saw was something far more  complicated: behind this urban sprawl was a pattern, almost a language,  which could not be understood through old modes of architectural and  urban criticism, but which had to be viewed through the organic facts of  its own ecologies.<\/p>\n<p>Esotouric guides Richard Schave and Kim Cooper studied under  Banham as undergraduates at UCSC, and both were deeply influenced by his  work. In Fall 2007, we launched the &#8220;Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles&#8221;  architectural series in tribute to our late professor, who showed us our  native Southern California through fresh eyes.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT REYNER BANHAM: Reyner Banham(1922-1988) was a prolific  architectural critic best known for &#8220;Theory and Design in the First  Machine Age&#8221; (1960) and &#8220;Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four  Ecologies&#8221; (1971). Professor Banham taught at the University of London,  SUNY Buffalo and the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he was  Chair of the Art History Department.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-381\" data-postid=\"381\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-381 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I learned to drive in order to read Los Angeles in the original\u00e2\u20ac\u009d -Reyner Banham, Architecture of Four Ecologies This provocative Esotouric bus adventure begins downtown and works its way south through Vernon, Bell Gardens, Santa Fe Springs and Downey, and through the past two centuries, exploring some of L.A.&#8217;s seldom-seen gems.
