We can summarize The Law of Thelema in the deceptively simple sentence \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d While the roots of O.T.O. lie in Freemasonry, it separated from that tradition a century ago under the leadership of noted magician Aleister Crowley. O.T.O. has a rich history in Los Angeles stretching back to the 1930s, when Wilfred Smith and Jack Parsons led Agape Lodge in Pasadena, the only fully operational O.T.O. body in the world at the time of Crowley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death in 1947.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The central ritual of Ordo Templi Orientis is the Gnostic Mass, also called Liber XV; a eucharistic ceremony written by Aleister Crowley in 1913. The most important purpose of the Mass is to lead all participants to an awareness of their divinity, an idea expressed in the declaration made by each member of the congregation after consuming the eucharist: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no part of me that is not of the gods.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d To this end, the Gnostic Mass incorporates dramatic ritual elements taken from Thelemic symbolism, as well as that of sources as disparate as alchemy, the Chaldean Oracles, and Qabalah. It is a beautiful and inspiring celebration of the energies of Life and Joy, of ecstatic union on all planes, and of the great Mystery of generation.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.starsapphire-oto.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Star Sapphire Lodge<\/a>, the O.T.O. body serving Los Angeles, invites you to join us in a celebration of the Gnostic Mass. We will also offer a brief talk on the nature of O.T.O. and the Gnostic Mass.
