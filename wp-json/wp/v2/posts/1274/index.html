The issues faced by the county\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership in the form of the Board of Supervisors had a profound effect on the economy and quality of life in what would become the most populous county in the nation. Many of these challenges, as examined in <em>The Courthouse Crowd: Los Angeles County and its Government, 1850-1950,<\/em>&nbsp;would persist in the post-World War II era and are still apparent today. In his presentation, author Tom Sitton discusses a few of these issues and some of the increasingly powerful Supervisors who faced them, share a colorful &#8220;rogues&#8217; gallery&#8221; of some of the most corrupt politicians in the region&#8217;s history, and describe how the book was written.&nbsp;<\/div>\n<p><object width=\"560\" height=\"315\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/o03mmBSFIMw?hl=en_US&amp;version=3\" \/><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><\/object><\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1274\" data-postid=\"1274\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1274 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On the last Sunday of each month , LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles (noon-2pm), for a loosely structured conversational Salon featuring short presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.
