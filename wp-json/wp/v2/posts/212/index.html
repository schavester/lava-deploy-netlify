Cain). Now they turn their creative attentions to Bukowski, the prolific poet, novelist and screenwriter whose rough-hewn tales of boozing, wild women and rotten jobs never obscure the deep vein of sweetness and hope that runs through all his work. In one of his finest poems, he described this as a bluebird he kept caged, and that bluebird is been represented in the Bukbird, a pale blue version of his beloved alcoholic crow character, represented by a logo created by cartoonist Tony Millionaire exclusively for this tour. The Bukbird is available on <a href=\"http:\/\/esotouric.com\/bukbirdtee\">T-shirts<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/esotouric.com\/coaster\">beer coasters<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/esotouric.com\/bukbirdposter\">fine art prints<\/a> by plasticmuse.<\/p>\n<p>For more info, see this <a href=\"http:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=DFINIROLblI&amp;feature=related\">short film<\/a> on the landmarking of Bukowski\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former bungalow on De Longpre.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-212\" data-postid=\"212\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-212 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This tour focuses on Bukowski\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great passions: writing, screwing and Los Angeles.
