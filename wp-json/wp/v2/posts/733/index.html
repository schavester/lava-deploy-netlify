In addition to the John Fante connection, it is the last bar standing in the neighborhood where novelist James M. Cain came to soak up the vernacular speech that he adapted into the hard-boiled American lingo of his breakout novel <em>The Postman Always Rings Twice<\/em> (1934).<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In recognition of the importance of the King Eddy as a place of abiding human comfort and cultural significance, LAVA is pleased to present this night of poetry and fiction, featuring three presenters who are great voices of Los Angeles:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/danfante.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Fante<\/a><\/strong> will read selections both from his poetry and his recently published memoir about growing up with his father, novelist John Fante, <a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/0062027093\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fante: A Family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Legacy of Writing, Drinking and Surviving<\/em><\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Novelist and poet\u00c2\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scabvendor.com\/blog\/\">Jonathan Shaw<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0<\/strong>will read a short story about his meeting with Charles Bukowski and the fist fight which ensued.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ruben Ortega<\/strong> is a local L.A. writer of short stories.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">LAVA co-founder Kim Cooper says: &#8220;Anyone who cares about the fragile coral ecosystem that is the culture of this city should make a visit to the King Eddy this summer, while it&#8217;s still under the Croick family&#8217;s ownership. They&#8217;ve made a haven in a very hard part of the city where folks who don&#8217;t have much money can feel respected and safe. That means everything. As we lose these ports, we lose our community and our history. Once that&#8217;s gone, it will never come back.&#8221;\u00c2\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-733\" data-postid=\"733\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-733 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On June 13, 2012, it was announced that after more than 50 years of family management, the King Eddy Saloon had been sold and would be closing at the end of the summer.\u00c2\u00a0This news has been received with great concern by the many people who consider this last Skid Row bar to be an essential [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","amp_status":"","spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[8,13,14,15,19,22],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p7lp7K-bP","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/733"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=733"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/733\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=733"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=733"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=733"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
