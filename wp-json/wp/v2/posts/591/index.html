You&#8217;ve heard all about Santa&#8217;s Evil Twin, who follows the Jolly One with burlap sack in hand, taking gifts away from miscreant children and giving them a thrashing to boot! This long-toothed, tongued charmer now has his very own CHOIR, who, in dulcet harmony, will regale our Visionaries and guests with such favorites as, &#8220;Bleeding through the Snow,&#8221; &#8220;O Shining Lump of Coal,&#8221; and &#8220;Bring a Switch, Jeannette Isabella.&#8221; King Krampus himself will be on hand to autograph your child&#8217;s deficiency notices.
