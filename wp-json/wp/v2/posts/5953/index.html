It changes the perception of the proceedings greatly and can influence the outcome. Often it takes the form of a witness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer to a question, but it can sometimes come in the form of new evidence.<br \/>\nBecause of modern discovery requirements, Perry Mason moments are rare in actual American court proceedings. Both sides are largely aware of what the other plans to introduce as evidence, and lawyers largely prefer not to ask witnesses questions when they do not have a good idea what the response will be.<\/p>\n<p>Two cases will be presented, both with Perry Mason Moments, both with bloodstain pattern interpretations, both from the multiple perspectives of the lab scientist-investigating detectives-prosecutors, both illustrating the upmost in prosecutorial ethics when those Perry Mason moments occurred.<\/p>\n<p>Presentation #1: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How The DNA Database Brought Christina Burmeister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Killers To Justice\u00e2\u20ac\u009d with retired LASD Detective Sgt. Joe Purcell, LASD Homicide Bureau Detective Deputy Phil Guzman, the prosecuting Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan (Assistant Head Deputy of the Pomona Branch), and retired LASD Senior Criminalist Lynne Herold.<\/p>\n<p>This presentation brings together a detective, forensic scientist and prosecuting attorney for a multi-dimensional journey into the investigation and prosecution of Christina Burmeister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murderer, a case that hinged upon the 2004 passage of Proposition 69, the DNA Fingerprint, Unsolved Crime and Innocence Protection Act. This law requires felons to submit DNA to a statewide database.<\/p>\n<p>On August 17, 2001, Christina Burmeister, 20, left her Cerritos home to attend a Cal Poly Pomona frat party. Before arriving, she was kidnapped, and her ATM card used at a bank. Burmeister was then driven up Highway 39 in Azusa Canyon, where her throat was slashed. Her body was found in her abandoned pickup truck, along with an abandoned plastic cigar tip, from which DNA evidence was extracted.<\/p>\n<p>In 2005, James Winslow Dixon, a felon who had been released from prison in 1993, was tied to the crime through DNA evidence. He and several compatriots were then charged with the murder of Christina Burmeister.<\/p>\n<p>Bloodstain patterns found at the scene were able to provide information about what happened during the murder and determine who was telling the truth: the three compatriots of the defendant who gave statements in an effort to avoid the death penalty, or the defense expert\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bloodstain pattern interpretation.<\/p>\n<p>Presentation #2 the People vs Kyle Christopher Jacobs (aka \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why you should never feel bad about your housekeeping skills\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) presented by retired Senior Criminalist Lynne Herold and the prosecuting Deputy District Attorney T. D. Pham.<\/p>\n<p>The victim (a friend of the defendant) died of a single shot gun wound to the head, a large metal mallet lay near his body in the driveway of the defendant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house. Was this a murder or, as the defendant claimed, a case of self-defense? What happens when a witness spontaneously testifies that the large metal mallet was first seen in a position other than depicted in the crime scene photographs?<div id=\"themify_builder_content-5953\"
