New developments suggested by LAVA Visionaries include: the world HQ of Ian Whitcomb&#8217;s ITW Industries and the&nbsp;consulate general of Smokessylvania, submitted by Count Smokula.&nbsp;Gene&#8217;s pitch to virtual developers: &#8220;Come live the Jet Age California dream when you stake out a virtual half-acre along Majestic Boulevard and plan the commercial development of your dreams. Maybe it&#8217;s tiki-themed bowling alley&#8230; or a no-tell motel named after your secret crush&#8230; or the lone Victorian farmhouse left behind when progress came to town.&#8221; Six months in the works, Gene returns to the Sunday Salon to unveil the expanded scroll to the lucky &#8220;property owners.&#8221; Also on view:&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; line-height: normal;\"><em>Untitled #1<\/em><span style=\"font-style: inherit;\">, &nbsp;whose theme might be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcImagining SoCal.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 This is a 13-inches-by-53-feet job, drawn from 1969-71, and was the last one the artist did before moving to L.A. The inspiration is mostly Southern California, and the work covers all four of Reyner Banham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ecologies. Bonus: a portion has the experimental &#8220;smog coat&#8221; the artist devised to make it &#8220;more like L.A.&#8221;<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-style: inherit;\">&nbsp;<\/span><strong>ABOUT GENE SCULATTI&#8217;S SCROLLS<\/strong><span style=\"font-style: inherit;\">: Since the age of 9, Sculatti, 63, has created imaginary horizontal cities packed with fascinating details that reflect his evolving obsessions: googie signage, soaring bridges, skyscrapers, suburbs, amusement parks and much more. Join us for a rare opportunity to get close to these beautiful and strange artworks, and to hear the artist discuss his inspirations, working methods, and how the scrolls have stayed with him for more than four decades.
