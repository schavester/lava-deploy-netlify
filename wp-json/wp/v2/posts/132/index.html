Years later, a young Charles Bukowski discovered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ask the Dust\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on the shelves at Central Library, and was himself inspired to become a writer. Fante Square&#8217;s nomination was initially proposed by LAVA founder Richard Schave, and made possible through the support of Councilmembers Jan Perry and Jose Huizar.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT JOHN FANTE:<\/strong> John Fante came to Los Angeles from Colorado in the midst of the Depression and soon found himself in a boarding house on Bunker Hill. Working odd jobs at the eastern foot of the hill and fortifying himself on a steady stream of reading material from the Central Library, he eventually became a published author\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan event immortalized through the achievements of his anti-hero alter-ego Arturo Bandini in the classic 1939 novel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ask The Dust.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Both the novel and the year are considered watersheds in Los Angeles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 literary history (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Day of the Locust,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Big Sleep,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After Many A Summer Dies The Swan\u00e2\u20ac\u009d).<\/p>\n<p>Fante soon left downtown to raise a family and begin a lifetime career as a screenwriter in Hollywood. But the downtown Los Angeles of his youth remained alive in his imagination, and in 1982, blind and nearing the end of his life, he dictated his last novel, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dreams From Bunker Hill,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to his wife Joyce.<\/p>\n<p>The impact of Fante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work on the wrap and weft of Los Angeles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rich cultural heritage is significant. The lost world of old Bunker Hill\u00e2\u20ac\u201da populated and thriving neighborhood overlooking the teeming civic bustle of downtown\u00e2\u20ac\u201dimmortalized in his novels captivates readers from almost every continent and shows the universality and abiding draw of Fante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prose.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-132\" data-postid=\"132\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-132 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Postscript: to see photos from this event, click here.
