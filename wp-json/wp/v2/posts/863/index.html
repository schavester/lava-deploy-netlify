All proceeds from sales will go towards the artists and funding the nonprofit fine art program.<\/p>\n<p>Begun in 1968 as a branch of ECF, the Art Center has mentored hundreds of adult artists living with autism, cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, and intellectual disabilities. The mission of the program is to give these gifted individuals a vehicle for personal expression and self-sufficiency by encouraging them to pursue careers in fine art. Throughout the years, the Art Centers have been nationally recognized for the personal and professional progress that artists within the program have made.<\/p>\n<p>Hundreds of contemporary art pieces ranging from sculptural and functional ceramics, paintings, original prints, and drawings will be for sale during the Fundraiser at prices that will accommodate all budgets. This event is a wonderful opportunity to get to know a remarkable community and experience and be able to take home profound works of art.<\/p>\n<p>Since 1946, ECF is the only organization of its kind in California which provides a continuum of lifespan services for developmentally disabled individuals serving over 2,000 people on an annual basis.<\/p>\n<p>For more information, please visit: www.artecf.org and www.ecf.net.
