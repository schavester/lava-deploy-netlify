Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood, as they searched for that elusive thing: a means by which a gifted writer could work in the remunerative field of motion pictures while not completely squandering their talent or losing their mind.  The focus of Ms. Crew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk will be the nexus of writers, directors, actors and professional wits who made the residential hotel The Garden of Allah their Hollywood home, with particular focus on Dorothy Parker and her conflicted relationship with this city. Mr. Kipen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk will explore the last few years of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life, particularly the Hollywood-themed Pat Hobby stories which he was working on at the time of his death.  Martin Turnbull will discuss and read from The Garden on Sunset, the first novel in his 9-book series \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Garden of Allah Novels,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d a fictional celebration of the culture of this legendary establishment. The series follows three naive hopefuls as they leap and lurch, win and lose their way though Hollywood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s golden years, with the Garden of Allah as the backdrop to their triumphs and failures.<\/p>\n<p>Also appearing at the Salon is Howard Prouty (Acquisitions Archivist at The Academy Foundation\/Margaret Herrick Library and proprietor of ReadInk) presenting on a famous Los Angeles book seller, the third in his ongoing Salon series. This time, this takes the form of a conversation between Howard Prouty and Michael Dawson, focusing on the history of Dawson&#8217;s Bookshop, an important part of L.A.&#8217;s cultural landscape since its founding by Michael&#8217;s grandfather Ernest Dawson in 1905. And before and after the formal dinner and Salon presentations, guests will mingle with Hollywood historian Philip Mershon (proprietor of The Felix in Hollywood Tour Company) and actress Kasey Wilson, appearing in the character of Miss Dorothy Parker.  The day before the Salon, you are invited to register for a free walking tour of Fitzgerald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hollywood, hosted by Ms. Crew. http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/fitzgeraldwalk2<\/p>\n<p>THE BACK STORY: For much of the mid-20th Century, to rub shoulders with America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest novelists and screenwriters, one needed merely to go to the corner of Cherokee Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard. Here, within the tight triangle of the Writer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guild offices, Musso &amp; Frank Grill and the Stanley Rose Bookshop, flowed the commercial and social sap that nourished the tree of American letters. The famous minds who congregated still inspire awe: William Faulkner, Scott Fitzgerald, John Fante, Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, William Saroyan, John O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hara, Dorothy Parker, Nathanael West and many more.<\/p>\n<p>And at the center of it all was the famed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Back Room\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of Musso &amp; Frank, the oldest restaurant in Hollywood. Beginning in 1936, in response to the restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing popularity, Musso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expanded its operations into a small room tucked behind the Vogue Theater. A door was punched through the west wall of the dining room, and a haughty door man installed. His instructions were simple: the back room was to be the exclusive domain of Hollywood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s literary lions, their friends and romantic partners. It was called, informally, The Cocktail Room or The Round Table or the Algonquin West.<\/p>\n<p>The party raged on, six nights a week, for twenty glorious years.<\/p>\n<p>In 1955, Musso &amp; Frank expanded to the east, and the contents of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Back Room\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthe long bar, chairs, light fixtures, coat racks\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwere moved wholesale into the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New Room.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New Room\u00e2\u20ac\u009d was no longer the exclusive retreat of literary Los Angeles, but the writers kept coming. Today, Musso &amp; Frank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clientele still includes celebrated novelists, screenwriters, poets and songwriters, all of whom cherish the old world hospitality, traditional Continental cuisine and opportunity to soak up the same rarified air that nourished the greats.<\/p>\n<p>In honor of this ongoing writerly tradition, LAVA (The Los Angeles Visionaries Association) is delighted to announce the January 2012 launch of The LAVA Salon at Musso &amp; Frank, a quarterly literary salon and prix fixe dinner celebrating the great writers and personalities who have frequented the establishment.<\/p>\n<p>The LAVA Salon at Musso &amp; Frank is the brainchild of Kim Cooper &amp; Richard Schave, proprietors of literary tour company Esotouric\u00e2\u20ac\u201dRaymond Chandler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Los Angeles, James M. Cain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Southern California Nightmare, Charles Bukowski\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Haunts of a Dirty Old Man, John Fante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dreams from Bunker Hill\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwho for the past twenty months have been hosting a free cultural Salon on the last Sunday of the month at Clifton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cafeteria (recently moved to the Los Angeles Athletic Club). With this new Salon series, LAVA expands its congenial, intelligent and unpredictable cultural programming into Hollywood with a quarterly literary Salon event held in Musso &amp; Frank on a night when the restaurant is closed to the general public. Seating is extremely limited, and this intimate gathering is sure to sell out quickly.<\/p>\n<p>LAVA co-founder Richard Schave, the Salon host and co-curator, says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would argue that along the bar in the old Cocktail Room, somewhere between the drinking, bragging, fighting and general hell-raising, the better half of the Hard-Boiled School of American Letters was hashed out and put down on paper. The purpose of the Salon is two fold. First, to set the record straight on some basic milestones: the rise and fall of the original Cocktail Room and its reincarnation as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153New Room\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and the symbiotic relationship Musso &amp; Frank shared with the legendary bookshop next door, Stanley Rose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Secondly, a more ephemeral aim: in these hallowed rooms, that still bear the nicotine stains from Raymond Chandler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pipe and Charles Bukowski\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cigarettes, we want to seek out and amplify the spark which all those great souls have left behind. Musso &amp; Frank is just bricks and mortar, but incredible ideas and connections were forged here, and we believe that spark is waiting to be reignited and make its impression felt in Los Angeles again.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p>Each Musso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Salon evening will focus on different aspects of Hollywood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s literary lore, feature fascinating speakers and special guest historians, and be hosted by LAVA co-founder Richard Schave.<\/p>\n<p>Mark Echeverria, 4th generation General Manager\/Proprietor of The Musso &amp; Frank Grill, says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For 93 years The Musso &amp; Frank Grill has been a keystone in Hollywood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever-evolving history. Some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest people have walked through our doors, sat at a booth or a bar stool, and dreamt the unimaginable. That is what makes Hollywood so unique: unimaginable things come true. Musso &amp; Frank Grill has always been that inspiration in people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives to make the impossible, possible, and it is now time to tell the true story of the people who put Hollywood on the map, and the restaurant they did it in\u00e2\u20ac\u201dThe Musso &amp; Frank Grill. We are extremely excited to work with LAVA to bring you living history in a setting where history continues to happen, even 93 years later. So please enjoy an authentic dinning experience you would have found in the early decades of last century, and bring yourselves back to the time era of the literary giants, and truly get a journey through the history of Hollywood, in the restaurant that Hollywood grew up around, The Musso &amp; Frank Grill.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p>Future Salons will focus on the life and works of Charles Bukowski, Jim Tully, Nathanael West and other fascinating characters who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve contributed to nearly a century of literary culture at Musso &amp; Frank.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-750\" data-postid=\"750\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-750 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>WHAT: The third of the quarterly LAVA Salons at Musso &amp; Frank, featuring Adrienne Crew &amp; David Kipen.
