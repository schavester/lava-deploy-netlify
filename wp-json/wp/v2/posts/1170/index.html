The name resonates. Blonde Bombshell. Platinum Blonde. The labels applied by press agents during Jean Harlow&#8217;s seven-year career still carry a charge seventy years later. Harlow created the mold: the first blonde sex symbol who captured the attention of a nation, then touched their hearts with her genuine warmth and candor. At a time when Harlow&#8217;s star shone its brightest, Los Angeles and the movies gave birth to a district that exists as much in the mind as on the map. Harlow historian Darrell Rooney, co-author of <a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/1883318963\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Harlow In Hollywood<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;(Angel City Press), discusses and presents images on the behind the scenes life of Jean Harlow and the city that helped mold her.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Presentation Two<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Marc Chevalier on James Oviatt and the Making of Modern Los Angeles History<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">Join Marc Chevalier, LAVA&#8217;s <\/span><a style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/lavavisionary2014\" target=\"_blank\">Visionary of the Year for 2014<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">, as he traces the life of the iconic Angeleno, James Oviatt, the man behind the eponymous building and clothing store. The unfolding of this narrative doubles as Marc&#8217;s personal narrative of research, through false leads, dead ends, misinterpretations and out of the blue miracles, until by uncovering the untold story of James Oviatt, Marc Chevalier discovers his own voice, that of a major historian of lost Los Angeles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Why look to James Oviatt, seller of upscale fashion, early proponent of the Art Deco, Machiavellian schemer and dreamer? Oviatt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arc is a microcosm of the upwardly mobile in Jazz Age Los Angeles, and his story touches almost every major aspect of culture and commerce in pre-war Los Angeles. His influence is still felt on the city he left behind, and in the worlds of fashion, design, marketing and architecture.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1170\" data-postid=\"1170\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1170 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Join&nbsp;LAVA&nbsp;for our revived free monthly Sunday Salon series.
