It&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Saturday&#8217;s events<\/strong>: Death Hags will gather in Los Angeles to meet new friends, tour amazing places, and hear fascinating people speak about horrible things.  In one day you can tour a disaster scene AND rub shoulders with the Los Angeles County Coroner.   On Saturday morning we&#8217;ll depart Los Angeles by coach for a day trip.  The first stop will be in Santa Clarita for the site of the St. Francis Dam disaster. Just before midnight on March 12, 1928, this newly constructed dam designed by William Mulholland burst, creating a 140 ft wave of over 40 billion gallons of water that killed over 450 people. There we&#8217;ll examine the ruins that still exist. Then we&#8217;ll motor on down to Pasadena for an exploration of the Arroyo Seco Bridge &#8211; better known to our crowd as The Suicide Bridge.  An expert on hand will share some of the colorful tales of this majestic \/ tragic landmark. Back to Hollywood to primp and preen for The Main Event &#8211; Saturday Night Cocktails (of course) and a buffet dinner in the Mountain View Mausoleum. Hosted by Scott Michaels, guest presenter is <em>Hollywood Remains to be Seen<\/em> and e-book pioneer, author Mark Masek. The main speaker of the evening will be Craig Harvey, Chief Coroner Investigator &amp; Chief of Operations Los Angeles County Department of Coroner. There will be several pleasant surprises throughout both evenings. There will be a silent auction and a raffle, both to benefit a grave marker for a yet undetermined notable Hollywood individual.  Raffle items and the grave marker recipient to be announced.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-833\" data-postid=\"833\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-833 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LAVA Visionary Joe Oesterle, author of the Weird Hollywood book will be a special guest at Dearly Departed Tours&#8216;&nbsp;First Annual Dearly Departed Weekend.
