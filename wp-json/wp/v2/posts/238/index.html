From intentionally toxic Italian powders meant to &#8220;accidentally&#8221; poison unwanted husbands to the startling adaption of the Art Deco style to mass-produced make-ups in the middle 1920s, her talk captivated LAVA attendees, who craned their necks to view the lovely preserved treasures in their glass cases and binders.<\/p>\n<p>Before and after the presentation, conversations around the room ranged from ghost hunting to UFO cults, lost Jackson 5 recordings to BookExpo, philosophy to urban preservation, new soundtracks for silent films to peculiar musical scores, neo-vaudeville to customized wheelchairs as art &#8212; and beyond. Friendships were formed, collaborations proposed, and all kinds of hungers slaked in this extraordinary monthly gathering of interesting folks who care about the city, the arts and one another.<\/p>\n<p>The Sunday Salon is always held on the last Sunday of the month, from noon to 2pm upstairs in Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria at 7th &amp; Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles.
