Its bootleg liquor, fizzy flappers, all night parties defined the Jazz Age in Los Angeles. When Scott Fitzgerald when came to L.A. in the mid 1930s with his $1000\/week contract at <\/span><span class=\"caps\" style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\">MGM<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\">, it was at the Garden of Allah he chose to land. it was also the home-away-from-home for Algonquin Round Table refugees Robert Benchley and Dorothy Parker, George S. Kaufman, Alexander Woollcott, Donald Ogden Stewart and Marc Connelly, so Fitzgerald must have feel at home. As did anyone answering Hollywood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s siren call lucky enough to get a room there.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\">Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk will be punctuated by readings from his first novel in the series, <\/span><em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/1466218959\">The Garden On Sunset<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong><em><\/em><\/strong><\/em><span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\"><strong>Back Story on the Garden of Allah: <\/strong>Formerly the movie star mansion of luminous silent screen star, Alla Nazimova, the Garden of Allah opened its doors in 1927 at the height of the Jazz Age and in no time, word got out that Nazimova\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Garden could always provide hopeful Hollywood arrivals with a pillow, a pal and a party. Over those years, a virtual who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s who of Hollywood paraded through the place: Bogie and Bacall, Errol Flynn, David Niven, Harpo Marx, Tallulah Bankhead, Artie Shaw, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Dorothy Gish, Kay Thompson, Leopold Stokowski, Orson Welles, Ava Gardner, and Frank Sinatra.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><strong><\/strong><\/strong><strong>Presentation Two: Marc Chevalier on the Crescent Heights Shopping Center &amp; the ballyhoo spirit of the Jazz Age<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For his talk, Marc Chevailer, the historian of the Oviatt Building, will focus on the Crescent Heights Shopping Center, just across the street from the Garden of Allah.  First drawn to the building because of James Oviatt&#8217;s proposed but&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\">never realized&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\">&#8220;satellite&#8221; shop for his famous haberdashery downtown, Marc soon become ensorcelled by this beautiful French Norman revival building.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\">Built in 1925, this towered, marble-trimmed and mansard-roofed Norman \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcchateau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 housed Schwab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pharmacy and the Crescent Heights Market, which fed, drugged and boozed the Garden of Allah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voracious guests. It was where Hollywood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movielanders shopped, schmoozed, strove and scrounged for generations \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 where F. Scott Fitzgerald nearly died and Marilyn Monroe got her final prescription, and where Robert Mitchum, already a star, stocked grocery shelves just for fun.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\">It was home to the Sunset Medical Center, the upscale Talmadge Jones flower shop (with its Rolls-Royce delivery trucks), a bakery, a dry cleaner, a beauty parlor, the infamous Crescent Heights Market (owned and managed by a cantankerous ex-speakeasy operator from New York, who randomly overcharged Hollywood&#8217;s elite for its groceries), and a pharmacy that would be bought out by Schwab&#8217;s in 1932. In 1949, Googie&#8217;s would build its first coffee shop next to Schwab&#8217;s.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\">While nothing remains of it today, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the chateau that housed Schwab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u009d  is ripe for rediscovery. Join Marc as he presents us a rich palimpsest of Hollywood from its halcyon era as he peels back the layers of the Crescent Heights Shopping Center, a compound which was drastically remodeled in the 1960s, and demolished in 1988.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Marc Chevalier stumbled across \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the chateau that held Schwab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00e2\u20ac\u009d while doing research for his upcoming biography of James Oviatt, the man behind L.A.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oviatt Building. In 2008, in partnership with filmmaker Seth Shulman, he researched\/wrote\/produced a feature-length <a href=\"http:\/\/puzzledpictures.com\/oviatts\/\">documentary<\/a> on the Oviatt Building\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. An English teacher by profession, Chevalier calls Los Angeles history his passion\/addiction, and credits Kim Cooper and Richard Schave for feeding it regularly.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1006\" data-postid=\"1006\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1006 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Join LAVA for our revived free monthly Sunday Salon series.&nbsp;We return to South Broadway, to the mezzanine of Les Noces du Figaro, which was recently opened by the family behind&nbsp;Figaro Bistro&nbsp;in Los Feliz.
