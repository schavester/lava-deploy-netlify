Andy Bales<\/a> of the <a href=\"http:\/\/urm.org\">Union Rescue Mission<\/a> (URM) for a 90-minute walking tour along the historic paths that have delineated Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. This tour derives from the ongoing 1947project <a href=\"http:\/\/insroland.org\/urmposts\">In SRO Land<\/a> blog series that uses the archives of the URM (founded 1891) as a tool for exploring the social and architectural history of the forgotten people and places of Downtown Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p>The tour begins with a survey of the early history of the outreach by the URM through its gospel wagon and at two now-lost buildings: the original home at 145 N. Main (now City Hall Lawn) and the long-time location at 226 S. Main (now a parking lot next to the former St. Vibiana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cathedral).<\/p>\n<p>The main themes will be the evolution of public policy on Skid Row, the transformative work of the URM, and the architectural history of the neighborhood.<\/p>\n<p>The route will include Main Street between 2nd and 3rd Streets (for a then\/now comparison of the surviving and demolished locations featured in the 1949 URM-financed short film \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of Scrap &amp; Steel,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d which will be screened later in the evening in a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/scrapsteel3\">free event that requires a separate reservation<\/a>). At 3rd and San Pedro Streets we will discuss the <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Azusa_Street_Revival\">Azusa Street Revival<\/a>, a transformative event in the spiritual history of Los Angeles and the West. During the walk back to the current home of the URM, Rev. Andy Bales will talk about issues and challenges facing the neighborhood and the URM today.<\/p>\n<p>The rendezvous point for the tour is the <a href=\"http:\/\/urm.org\">URM<\/a>\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters at at 6th and San Pedro Streets. A free shuttle bus will take tour attendees to 2nd and Main Streets, where the walking tour begins. Registration is required, and each attendee must register separately, to ensure sufficient seating on the shuttle bus.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Parking<\/strong> is available at the URM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underground parking lot.  Just tell the attendent you are there for the walking tour.  If everyone attending arrives with one other person in their car, there should be enough parking for all.  Those arriving latter will have to leave their keys with the parking attendent.  There is also parking at Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parking lot at&nbsp;the SW corner of 2nd &amp; San Pedro (<a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?q=237+S.+San+Pedro+St+Los+Angeles,+CA+90013&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=34.048742,-118.241947&amp;spn=0.004285,0.006899&amp;sll=34.048726,-118.241978&amp;layer=c&amp;cbp=13,218.4,,0,22.03&amp;cbll=34.048742,-118.241947&amp;gl=us&amp;hnear=237+S+San+Pedro+St,+Los+Angeles,+California+90012&amp;t=m&amp;z=17&amp;panoid=4oLX6UNE5ji0_DqkyEvq6A\">MAP<\/a>) if the URM lot fills up.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Nearest Metro station<\/strong> is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Little_Tokyo_\/_Arts_District_%28Los_Angeles_Metro_station%29\">Little Tokyo<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-809\" data-postid=\"809\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-809 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To sign up for this free event: First register as a user on this site, and then return to this page.
