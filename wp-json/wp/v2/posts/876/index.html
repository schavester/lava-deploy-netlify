She exhibits and designs public art commissions in the US and Asia. Her work is about energy and transition. She is also a practitioner of Feng Shui and Neuro-Architecture (how environments affect human expression). She is also a poet and columnist for Sushi&amp;Sake monthly.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Tomo Isoyama was born and raised in Tokyo, and now lives and works in Los Angeles. He is best known for his mural-size photographic works which juxtapose motifs from various cultures (hamburgers, lucky charms) into a visual presentation based on a mandala or a Gothic stained glass window. He exhibits internationally.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Amy Inouye, a third-generation Japanese American, is a book designer and visual artist. Her art practice combines relational installation art (work which invites non-artists to participate in work in an art context) and sometimes yarn-bombing. She is involved in all kinds of historic LA stuff, including saving the statue of Chicken Boy to championing the Los Angeles Public Library&#8217;s photograph collection.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Regular hours for Future Studio Gallery &amp; Chicken Boy Shop: Saturdays noon to 5pm, and by appointment.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This exhibit will be on display to Feb. 2, 2013.<\/p>\n<p> <!--EndFragment--><\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-876\" data-postid=\"876\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-876 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Artists: Nancy Uyemura, Tomo Isoyama, Amy Inouye It&#8217;s almost a new year already again, and we feel like everyone could probably use a soft reboot&#8211;so we&#8217;ll have some lucky artwork to get you in a positive mood (you&#8217;ll get a lucky buzz), then you can put your hopes and wishes on a peace tree (well, [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":26,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","amp_status":"","spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[7,13],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p7lp7K-e8","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/876"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/26"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=876"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/876\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=876"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=876"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=876"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
