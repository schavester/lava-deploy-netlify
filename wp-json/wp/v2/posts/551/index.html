On the Esotouric bus, you&#8217;ll travel back in time to map the musical history of Hollywood and West Hollywood, from Beatlemania and folk rock, glitter rock through punk. Along the way you&#8217;ll follow the career highs and lows of a selection of fascinating LA artists: Bobby Fuller (was it murder or suicide?), Phil Spector, Arthur Lee &amp; Love and the Byrds.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; font-family: Arial, Geneva, Webdings, sans-serif;\">From the teen riots over the closing of Pandora&#8217;s Box (inspiration for the Buffalo Springfield hit &#8220;For What It&#8217;s Worth&#8221;) to the late night Canter&#8217;s Deli scene, from adolescent groupies holding court at Rodney&#8217;s English Disco to the wild dances invented at Ciro&#8217;s, and so much between, Where The Action Was is a high-energy voyage to a time when music was thrilling, immediate and deeply rooted to the city of LA.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; font-family: Arial, Geneva, Webdings, sans-serif;\">Passenger feedback: &#8220;Just wanted to say how much I thoroughly enjoyed the recent &#8220;Where the Action Was&#8221; rock tour. Wow! The perfect blend of history and pastiche. Amazing that you can pull this off so smoothly in such a difficult city to traverse. I have been living and walking the streets of the tour area for the past six years and never realized half of the history behind all of those great venues I passed. You truly enlightened me in such an insightful, fun manner. I will be sure to recommend your fantastic tours to everyone I know.&#8221; (Matthew Turner, Writer\/Producer of&nbsp;<a style=\"color: red;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.happytrailershd.com\/\">THE JUKEBOX: FROM EDISON TO IPOD<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-551\" data-postid=\"551\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-551 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Announcing a very special edition of Where The Action Was, co-sponsored by Esotouric and 100.3 The Sound, and featuring special guest pop star Ian Whitcomb and on-air personalities from 100.3 and a reception at Capitol Records.
