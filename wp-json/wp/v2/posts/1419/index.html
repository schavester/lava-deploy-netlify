The newly published <em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/1502898284\" target=\"_blank\">Tales of An Ancient Go-Go Girl<\/a><\/em> by long-time Long Beach, California resident Joan Jobe Smith, is a picaresque True Tale, a 50-year Glotessey spanning the 1965 Los Angeles Watts Riots, near death at the hands of a homicidal ex-husband, the counter-culture go-go swinging let-it-all-hang-out 1960s-\u00e2\u20ac\u02dc70s, single Motherhood and Feminism. Rarely does a natural poet and historian such as Joan Jobe Smith endure such ordeals and challenges and survive to tell the tale. It is a Tale written with go-going panache and patois, and heart, courage and humor to make our lives richer and wiser. The event will be a series of short Q&amp;As with LAVA&#8217;s Richard Schave on milestones from the memoir, punctuated by Joan reading poetry selections which span her career.<\/p>\n<p>Excerpts from 5-Star Reviews of <em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/1502898284\" target=\"_blank\">Tales of An Ancient Go-Go Girl<\/a><\/em>:<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Charles Bukowski said the inimitable Joan Jobe Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s writing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchas the reality of force properly put down on paper; she cuts herself loose into the stratosphere.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Joan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart is so damned big. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not only cut herself loose into the stratosphere, she takes anyone who wants to go with her along for the ride.

Jakiela, Creative Writing Professor, University of Pittsburgh<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vividly conjures up the dark shadows and wisecracks of a Film Noir, set in 1960s-\u00e2\u20ac\u02dc70s L.A., with a cast of glamourous yet vulnerable dancers, slimy bosses, wharf rats (both rodents, ex-husband and customers) with walk-ons by celebrities (Dick Dale, Ike and Tina Turner) amongst the burgeoning pop music and drug counter-culture of the era. Energized by Joan Jobe Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poetic eye and exuberant syntax, these true Tales will enthrall readers, revealing its author as a brilliant chronicler of her Noir-ish life and times.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u201dJules Smith, London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <em>Times Literary Supplement<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just finished reading Joan Jobe Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <em><span class=\"caps\">Tales of An Ancient Go-Go Girl<\/span>.<\/em> She has such a descriptive, poetic talent for words as she weaves her true life tales of love, jealousy, near murder and trials.
