I grew up around clay and artists. I never had to make the decision of what to do when I grew up, because I never did. I remember playing in the mud when I was four years old and knowing that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthis is it!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 When I was young and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the patience or technical understanding to make entire pieces, I would just make the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpants,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and it would inevitably turn into a planter.<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The work in this show is an extension of the idea of childlike simplicity that has always been my focus. They somehow make themselves, in that they are kind of a default image of a recurring daydream that I always come back to. Clay has always been my favorite medium. It is the most immediate infinite material. The process of making these pieces is hypnotic. They are just coil pots, really, I just roll out coils and keep adding on until I reach the top. These pieces don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need your analysis or theories. Accept them as they are. Enjoy them as you would a friend. I do.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p>Stan Edmondson is an artist, ceramicist, printmaker, and photographer working in Pasadena.
