This is a day to nurture body and soul, commune with your muse, and above all write. Women writers of all experience levels and interests are warmly welcomed. <\/p>\n<p>Participants may join writing circles to inspire imagination and hone craft, write quietly in community with others, wander to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153farmhouse table\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for talk about writing and group feedback, or simply sit under a tree and dream. In <br \/>the afternoon, industry professionals and Hedgebrook alumnae will be available for one-on-one mentoring. Feedback on work will always be given with the utmost respect for the writer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision. Participants should note, however, that <br \/>the Retreat is a day for rejuvenation, not for detailed manuscript review. <\/p>\n<p>Enjoy a day inspired by Hedgebrook!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hedgebrook.org\/newsdetails.php?id=60\">Click here for details or registration info<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-718\" data-postid=\"718\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-718 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp;LAVA Visionaries April Dammann and Adrienne Crew are alumnae of Hedgebrook, a writers retreat for women located on an island in the Puget Sound of Washington State.
