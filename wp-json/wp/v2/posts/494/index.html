The forces that impacted founder Robert Crosbie from his arrival in 1911, and how he and his brethren shaped their spiritual and educational environment over the decades, are a fundamental narrative of the city. Theosophy, like Los Angeles, straddles two kingdoms, the finite and the infinite, imbued with fascinating contradictions: love, wealth, greed, power and release. Victoria Prinz is a member of the ULT, and she&#8217;ll take some of these themes as a starting point for this discussion on the extraordinary legacy of the ULT in Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-494\" data-postid=\"494\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-494 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Special program at the May 29, 2011 Salon: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Artist \/ musician and LAVA Visionary Rich Polysorbate 60 was born five years after the shipwreck of the S.S.
