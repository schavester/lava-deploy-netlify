Yes, the mob had a hand in clubs. Stage Door Johnnies sent jewels. Some of the biggest names walked across the burly stages; Abbott and Costello, Gypsy Rose Lee, Bert Lahr, Sophie Tucker and on and on. But there were hundreds of men and women who worked week after week, year after year. Who were they? Where did they come from?
