This concept of hope is a fitting metaphor for cosmetics.&nbsp; Each container of face powder or jar of cold cream represents the dreams and desires of a woman seeking a magic potion that would make her beautiful. The exquisite and fragile packages used to market these dreams became the Pandora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boxes of the early 20th century. Joan Renner has been collecting vintage cosmetics ephemera for over fifteen years. She has an extensive collection of commercial face powder boxes, rouge tins, advertisements, hair net packages and bobby pin cards. Please join her for a discussion of topics ranging from the design of the packaging to the use of arsenic laden face powder by women in 17th Century Italy to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accidentally\u00e2\u20ac\u009d poison their unwanted husbands. Once gracing women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dressing tables, various unique and beautiful items from Joan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collection will be also be on display. These include items featured in her blog <a href=\"http:\/\/vintagepowderroom.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Vintage Powder Room<\/a> and some never before exhibited.

The world has only gotten more phenomenal since Fort\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time, and the League of Western Fortean Intermediatists (L.O.W.F.I.) ensures that his spirit lives on: neither cranks nor skeptics, Forteans are characterized by their objectivity, good humor and lust for supernormal adventure. Based in Los Angeles, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma,sans-serif;\">L.O.W.F.I.&#8217;s<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Tahoma,sans-serif;\"> focus is on the long, strange life of the American southwest, gathering to discuss its enigmas, peculiarities and unexplainable events. Gonzo journalist and <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">L.O.W.F.I. founder Skylaire Alfvegren has spent a lifetime researching the weird, wacky and unexplainable history of her hometown of Los Angeles.
