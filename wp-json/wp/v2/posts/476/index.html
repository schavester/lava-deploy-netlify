It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fabulous way to get project funding. Each donation level has great prizes attached, if the project doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come through no money goes out, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just an inspiring and fun way to get your information out into the world.)<\/p>\n<p>The project is a Re-purposed Circus in Baraboo, WI (Circus City, USA)- It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the birthplace of the American circus and former home of the Ringling Brothers, now home to Circus World Museum. LAVA member Laura Brody and Heidi Dakter want to create a circus parade by live draping the local ringmaster and clowns from Circus World and the people of the town in old circus materials and making them into the parade. They&#8217;ve got workshops planned for creating memory boxes out of old memorabilia (Heidi) and making your own garments from old materials (Laura) and gallery shows from great local sources- the old circus costumes of Circus World and from American Players Theater, plus the whimsical metal creatures of Dr. Evermor and his Forevertron.<\/p>\n<p>The Kickstarter project deadline is Sunday, June 5th at 6:46 PST.<\/p>\n<p>Please come and see the project on Kickstarter, share the link and be inspired to fund your own dreams! Now, Laura Brody never claimed to be a filmmaker, but the stop motion film was fun (though slow) to make. She&#8217;s filled with admiration for the makers of South Park now&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The short link is: <a href=\"http:\/\/kck.st\/mEbDfg\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/kck.st\/mEbDfg<\/a><\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-476\" data-postid=\"476\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-476 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The project is coming due&#8230; please check it out on Kickstarter and share the link so we can go to Circus City!
