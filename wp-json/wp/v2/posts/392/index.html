About 20 permits have been submitted, and we&#8217;ll soon be sketching out sites and putting pen and crayon to paper. I expected Visionaries to be creative, but I was surprised by the diversity of suggestions put forth.<\/p>\n<p>Among the best: a radio station (with a 12-story antenna) <em>and<\/em> an offshore pirate radio station&#8230; a cannabis club-pizza parlor&#8230;riding stables&#8230; harbor or&nbsp; port&#8230; an organization to help the homeless&#8230;offices of the Consulate General of Smokesylvania (from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.countsmokula.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Count Smokula<\/a>)&#8230; a live &#8216;steam club&#8217; (not the shvitzing kind; Majestic&#8217;s already got one)&#8230; a red-light district and &#8220;fun center&#8221;&#8230; a verison of Bunker Hill&#8217;s famous <a href=\"http:\/\/onbunkerhill.org\/sunshineapartments\" target=\"_blank\">Sunshine Apartments<\/a>&#8230; a factory manufacturing records&#8230; a cemetery&#8230; a prison&#8230; Johnny Hallyday Convalescent Home&#8230;&#8221;Ciro&#8217;s type night club&#8221;&#8230; Edith Massey&#8217;s thrift shop&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Have been promised a few more permits, to be submitted by e-mail. Once we get rolling, I&#8217;ll keep Visionaries updated on the progress of this project. Getting all this construction onto the new strip of real estate suggests I&#8217;ll be throwing all previous zoning regulations out the window.
