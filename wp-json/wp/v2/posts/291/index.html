Come watch The Haunting (1963), inside reputedly haunted, abandoned Linda Vista Hospital in Boyle Heights. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This &nbsp;fundraising event is a private, by invitation\/RSVP only. There will be only 150 seats available, so be quick to RSVP at the Facebook event page and secure your seat. BHPP will go down the list of RSVP&#8217;s and select the first 150. &nbsp;There is a $5 per person suggested donation and your name MUST be on the list to gain entry.<\/p>\n<p>This is only a movie showing and not an invitation to investigate. The movie will be shown inside Linda Vista Hospital.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Linda Vista and BHPP have the right to refuse entry to anyone who we feel poses a threat to the safety of others and will exercise that right, so NO SNAPPERS! Oh yeah, RSVP means you saved a seat for yourself and not 20 others. Security will be provided as well as some parking. Please understand that if you decide to try and walk around the hospital you will be in direct violation of the directions that will be given, and removed from the property. There will be popcorn and hot dogs and candy for sale with profits going to a good cause, please be sure to bring a lawn\/beach chair to sit in and a sweater, the inside of the hospital can be scary cold!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Next months movie will be outside and aimed toward those who could not attend this premier. ***THIS IS A MOVIE***NOT A INVESTIGATION*** although you could be part of the after tour that will be offered for a suggested $20 donation. We will announce this on movie night. Bring your cameras as you never know what you&#8217;ll catch staring at you from the windows.<\/p>\n<p>Co-Hosted by:<\/p>\n<p>Ghost Hunters Of Urban Los Angeles&nbsp; <br \/>3AM Paranormal &nbsp;<br \/>Antelope Valley Haunts &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555; font-family: arial, 'Lucida Grande', 'Bitstream Vera Sans', verdana, sans-serif; line-height: 14px;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #555555;\"><br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555; font-family: arial, 'Lucida Grande', 'Bitstream Vera Sans', verdana, sans-serif; line-height: 14px;\"><br \/><\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-291\" data-postid=\"291\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-291 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Join the Boyle Heights Paranormal Project for the very first Fright Night In The Heights!
