Dr. King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial communication with the Cosmic Master Aetherius occurred in 1954, spurring Dr. King on to found the Society in England the following year. He ran it until his death in 1997; Paul Nugent was a personal assistant to Dr. King and is a current Director of the organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s American headquarters. Part of the work of The Aetherius Society is predicated on Prayer, and the mental direction of positive energy towards the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trouble spots in a manifestation of the concept that consciousness can impact objective reality. The presentation will provide an overview of the fascinating spiritual history of this Hollywood ashram and its ongoing role in the development of new religious thought and action.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Presentation Two<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/artdock.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">Carlton Davis<\/a> was the curator and creator of the seminal 1980s micro gallery The Art Dock, located on a loading dock of the endangered 1888 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.laconservancy.org\/issues\/james-k-hill-sons-pickle-works-building\" target=\"_blank\">Pickle Works Building<\/a>, and is author of&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/1461082102\" target=\"_blank\">The Art Dockuments: Tales of the Art Dock: The Drive-by Gallery<\/a><\/em>.
