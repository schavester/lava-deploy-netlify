If pure Victorian architecture is considered, one likely turns attention to the Eastlake and Queen Anne examples along Carroll Avenue, or to the used-car lot of gingerbread, Heritage Square.<\/p>\n<p>This does a disservice, asserts Marsak, to the wonderland of Richardsonian Romanesque, Romanesque Revival, and Romanesque-hybrid office blocks and civic structures that once defined our city. A confluence of money and local pride, primarily in the late-1880s, resulted in what was arguably America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest center of the style, short-lived though it may have been. The ethos of the City Beautiful movement, skyscraper construction, and other factors contributed to its demise.<\/p>\n<p>It is especially striking that these structures, whose construction exuded solidity and permanence, should have been removed on so great a scale. Besides illuminating twenty of the most notable lost masterpieces, Marsak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lecture visits those few remaining examples of the style. Attention is given as well to the styles that fought for dominance in defining Victorian Los Angeles, e.g., French Empire.<\/p>\n<p>Video <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Z1_udvVaoD0\" target=\"_blank\">link<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Z1_udvVaoD0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1441\" data-postid=\"1441\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1441 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On the last Sunday of each month, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles, for a structured Salon featuring formal presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.
