Within this small footprint, we will discover some of the most fascinating structures in L.A. history, most of them quite forgotten.<\/p>\n<p>The tour is inspired by the September 2011 launch of a <a href=\"http:\/\/insroland.org\/urmposts\" target=\"_blank\">new series<\/a> on the In SRO Land time travel blog featuring archival material from the collection of the <a href=\"http:\/\/urm.org\">Union Rescue Mission<\/a>, which presents an opportunity for exploring the lost lore of the old commercial neighborhood which was largely cleared via eminent domain in the 1920s and 1930s in order to provide a clean slate for the erection of City Hall and other government buildings. This was a precursor to the much larger and more destructive eminent domain project by which the residential neighborhood Bunker Hill was cleared in the 1950s and 1960s.<\/p>\n<p>Locations on the walking tour will include Joseph Newsom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exquisite Bryson-Bonebrake Block (1888), first two Union Rescue Mission locations, and the original \u00e2\u20ac\u0153civic center\u00e2\u20ac\u009d encompassing the Courthouse (1887), the Hall of Records (1911) and the State Building (1931).<\/p>\n<p>To start, we will seek to answer some basic questions about the early development of downtown Los Angeles:<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Who were the architects and financiers of 19th Century Los Angeles?<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0Which buildings were most representative of these individuals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 aims, and which were the most significant architecturally?<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0What did the Victorian-era Angeleno think of the architecture of his city?<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\u00c2\u00a0How did architecture reflect the growth of the city?<\/p>\n<p>Having established these early themes, we will start to ask questions about the emotional and spiritual core of the city of Los Angeles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c-its zeitgeist\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand begin to draw the connection between architecture and the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture.<\/p>\n<p>An example is the discussion of the Union Rescue Mission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first two buildings at 145 N. Main Street and 226 S. Main Street. More than a century ago, the URM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique mission brought them to the heart of Skid Row, a place filled with characters and scenery worthy of Victor Hugo, and it keeps them there to this day. The city has twice forced a move of the URM as it seeks to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153move along\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the disenfranchised and those who seek to aid them. These snapshots of lost architectural spaces that were once an intrinsic part of a dynamic urban core tell us much about the tensions and forces still at play in the community.<\/p>\n<p>The tour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closing thoughts are inspired by a quote from Hugo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <em>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame<\/em>: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When a man understands the art of seeing, he can trace the spirit of an age and the features of a king even in the knocker on a door.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p>TAKING THIS TOUR:\u00c2\u00a0This tour is now full.

The core notion of the series is of culture and history as commodities that are packaged and sold to a target demographic; meanwhile, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the ignored and seemingly worthless scraps of meaning found on the sidewalks and marketplaces where the true remnants of positive public space can be found. All interpretations and nuisances of the word fl\u00c3\u00a2neur are examined\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfrom the modern-day aesthete dreaming of Baudelaire while carried along in the human tide past the stalls and shops of Broadway, to its more recent and perhaps relevant use, someone who is loitering. At its heart this series is a celebration of the simple act of getting out of your car, walking through a neighborhood and learning to see it with your own eyes.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-545\" data-postid=\"545\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-545 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This tour is now full.
