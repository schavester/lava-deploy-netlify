In this cultural and architectural history of how Los Angeles came to understand the community mausoleum, Marsak charts the southland&#8217;s parallels with and digressions from America&#8217;s developing mores and attitudes toward the space of death.<\/p>\n<p>Emerging from the early 20th-century Garden Cemetery movement, Los Angeles not only contributed the concept of the memorial park, but also many of the finest&#8211;and sometimes strangest&#8211;grand public mausolea known. Los Angeles, long noted for its mimetic &#8220;California Crazy&#8221; and futuristic Googie architecture, needed, in its funerary architecture, to strive for solemnity and sublimity. &nbsp;Nevertheless, its cemetery buildings betray a peculiar and genuinely Southern Californian ethos in their expression.<\/p>\n<p>Discussed are the 1903 Chapel of the Pines crematory and columbarium; the early community mausolea of the &#8216;teens; the interbellum wonders of Forest Lawn&#8217;s neogothic Great Mausoleum, Angeles Abbey&#8217;s Arabian wonderland, and early-Christian meets Art Deco at Calvary Cemetery. Particular study is given to the postwar era and the specific challenges mausoleum design faced adapting to Modernism&#8211;it is during this period they are routinely disparaged as filing cabinet necro-tenements&#8211;and how new considerations of population and land management influenced the building of open garden-court mausolea and columbaria.<\/p>\n<p>Their legacy has left us with a means to gauge the city&#8217;s development (as well as remarkable tile work and stained glass). &nbsp;Through this lens, Marsak reveals this significant, yet little-valued aspect of our architectural landscape.<\/p>\n<p><object width=\"420\" height=\"315\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/ktNQabEXNk4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"><\/param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"><\/param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><\/param><\/object><\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1288\" data-postid=\"1288\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1288 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On the last Sunday of each month, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles, for a structured Salon featuring formal presentations and opportunities to meet and connect with one another.
