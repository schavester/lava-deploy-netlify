Over a period of four hours, we visited a number of locations which I would describe as &#8220;psychic hot spots.&#8221; So, what is a psychic hot spot? This has to be my definition because, to my knowledge, no one else has used this nomenclature. Let me describe some of my personal hot spots. When I get off the subway at Lenox and 135th Street in Harlem, I feel an incredible surge of energy rise from the soles of my feet to the top of my head. At the Capitoline Museum in Rome, I have discovered an 1800-year-old marble bust that could be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/profile\/pic.php?oid=AAAAAQAQMEF1ikKKKylck6ORg4NbZgAAAAqAAGCKEbRB5V-Ok7gI4eSl\" target=\"_blank\">my portrait<\/a>. On my only trip to the souk in Fez, Morocco, it all looked familiar. I knew that I had been there before. After discussing these experiences with Maja, she concurred with my perceptions.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Following Maja to a number of locations, mostly around Hollywood, I knew that I was moving in and out of psychic energy fields. On the surface, each one appeared to be a conventional Los Angeles location; however, I knew that there was something special to be explored at each location. Here is a recap of the highlights from my point of view.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vedanta.org\" target=\"_blank\">Vedanta Society<\/a> (1946 Vedanta Place, Hollywood, 90068) <br \/>Perched above the Hollywood Freeway, one is transported into the world of a sanctified Eastern religion with the peace and quiet that it embodies. &#8220;Vedanta teaches that man&#8217;s real nature is divine, that the true object of human life is to unfold and manifest this divinity, and that truth is universal.&#8221; Here one finds a temple, a convent, a monastery and an outstanding bookstore devoted to Eastern religions.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.aetherius.org\" target=\"_blank\">The Aetherius Society<\/a> (6202 Afton Place, Los Angeles, 90028)&nbsp; <br \/>&#8220;The Cosmic Teachings of The Aetherius Society were given by Masters from Beyond this Earth, operating mainly within our own Solar System and speaking through yoga Master Dr. George King.&#8221; We saw a video projection of Dr. King taking us on a terrestrial journey. Unfortunately, I slept through most of it. This recalled a similar somnambulist experience when I was in a graduate school art history seminar. When the lights came on, my professor pounded the table yelling&nbsp; &#8220;Mr. Schoener we don&#8217;t sleep in my classes.&#8221; I should have apologized to our hosts, but was too embarrassed.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>The finale was a visit to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foursquare.org\/landing_pages\/81,3.html\" target=\"_blank\">Parsonage<\/a> of Aimee Semple McPherson&#8217;s Foursquare Angelus Temple (1801 Park Avenue, Los Angeles, 90026). Our guide, Jackie Muller, never actually met Sister Aimee, but she provided a knowledgeable and impassioned tour of her private quarters. Hundreds of thousands of people in thirty countries became disciples of Sister Aimee&#8217;s Four Square Gospel evangelism. The first years of her ministry were spent in tents, tabernacles and auditoriums. Sister McPherson felt led by&nbsp; God to build a permanent headquarters in&nbsp; Los Angeles. The Angelus Temple, adjacent to the parsonage,&nbsp; opened on January 1, 1923. Together, they serve as monuments to the memory of this extraordinary person.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>Is Los Angeles special because of its&nbsp; psychic hot spots? I would definitely say so.<\/p>\n<p><em>Illustration: Sister Aimee&#8217;s personal bathroom in the parsonage, photo: Kim Cooper<br \/><\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-155\" data-postid=\"155\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-155 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 1939, Semyon Kirlian discovered that it was possible to create photographic images demonstrating the &#8220;life force&#8221; which is manifested as an individual&#8217;s aura.
