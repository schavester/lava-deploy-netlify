Punks and smackdowns with L.A. Police. We&#8217;ll crawl through the Sewers of Paris, tattle on the Ivar Theater, and get the lowdown on Tom&#8217;s legendary performances at the Wiltern and elsewhere. Before departing for points rural, Tom left his mark all over L.A., from Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s Zoetrope Studios to Sunset Sound to Skid Row. We&#8217;ll show you where Tom found his true love and collaborator, Kathleen Brennan, and how all the pieces came together to transform a drunken, desperate singer into the multi-faceted, multi-media artist he&#8217;d become.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 23.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 23.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">Raised near San Diego, Tom Waits launched his musical career in L.A., signing with David Geffen&#8217;s Asylum Records in 1972, living at the raunchy Tropicana Hotel (where he sawed off the kitchen drain board so his piano would fit), and building a reputation as a songwriter willing to risk his own health and sanity to get inside the sad sack characters that peopled songs like &#8220;The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me),&#8221; &#8220;On The Nickel&#8221; and &#8220;Pasties And A G-string (At The Two O&#8217;clock Club).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 23.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">By 1980, Tom was 31 and starting to feel the effects of his hard living. While scoring the music to Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s &#8220;One From The Heart,&#8221; he met Kathleen Brennan, whose influence would completely transform his life and his art. After a whirlwind courtship the pair married and began a 28-year creative and personal partnership, beginning with the revolutionary album &#8220;Swordfishtrombones,&#8221; the subject of tour host David Smay&#8217;s new book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 23.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 23.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 23.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">As a symbolic passage from lonesome bar hopping to family joys and sobriety, the tour starts and ends at two important downtown sites. Passengers gather in the King Edward Saloon, the last surviving Skid Row bar with the Christmas 2007 loss of Craby Joe&#8217;s, before boarding Esotouric&#8217;s luxury coach class bus, where the mood is set with vintage photos and live footage. &#8220;Crawling Down Cahuenga&#8221; spans Tom&#8217;s personal city, from The Nickel (aka Skid Row) to once-ratty West Hollywood, favorite strip clubs and midnight diners, recording studios, night clubs, record labels and film studios, before rolling back downtown for a communal snack at Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 23.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; line-height: 23.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;\">ABOUT THE HOSTS: Longtime collaborators David Smay and Kim Cooper co-edited the books &#8220;Bubblegum Music is the Naked Truth&#8221; (&#8220;quite simply the most fun music book I have ever read.&#8221; -Bucketfull of Brains) and &#8220;Lost in the Grooves: Scram&#8217;s Capricious Guide to the Music You Missed&#8221; (&#8220;the perfect book for the advanced record collector&#8221; -Ear Candy) before penning their solo 33 1\/3 series books on Tom Waits and Neutral Milk Hotel.
