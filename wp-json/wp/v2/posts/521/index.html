She is currently on the Board of the 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica, California. She has taught sculpture and drawing, exhibited both in solo and group shows, and completed a few large-scale sculpture commissions. She has done several unique performance pieces at various venues in southern California.   Dakin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most well known work was a year-long performance campaign around the United States as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An Artist for President\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in 1983-84, in which she advanced the idea that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Nation is the art work and we the people are the artists.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The book about that campaign, as timely today as it was then, is being published in fall 2011. Dakin will reprise the campaign as a book tour. &nbsp;<\/span><strong>About &#8220;An Artist for President&#8221;<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: inherit;\"><span style=\"font-style: inherit;\">: In 1984, Reagan was running for his second-term, while pursuing what would become a relentless, multi-decades long retreat from democratic ideals. Susanna Dakin, sculptor, performance artist and <\/span><em>High Performance Magazine<\/em><span style=\"font-style: inherit;\"> publisher, had an outlandish notion: she declared with the Federal Elections Commission as an Artist\/Candidate for President of the United States. Now a compelling and high-entertaining book, as timely today as it was then, <\/span><em>An Artist for President<\/em><span style=\"font-style: inherit;\"> makes a case for the vital role of art and creativity in all aspects of life, including politics. This &#8220;biography of an event,&#8221; records the loony ideas people hold about woman, artists and the political process. November is Election Month, so cast your vote for art, civil liberties and freedom of expression, by attending this fun refection on where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been and where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;\"><span style=\"font-weight: inherit;\"><span style=\"font-style: inherit;\">\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2&nbsp;<\/span><\/span>LAVA is proud (and not too terrified, since we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been good this year!) to present the KRAMPUS CHOIR, who will literally kick-start the holiday season with their odes to the Real ghost of Christmas, Lord Krampus.
