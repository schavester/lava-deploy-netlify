Punks and smackdowns with L.A. Police. We&#8217;ll crawl through the Sewers of Paris, tattle on the Ivar Theater, and get the lowdown on Tom&#8217;s legendary performances at the Wiltern and elsewhere. Before departing for points rural, Tom left his mark all over L.A., from Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s Zoetrope Studios to Sunset Sound to Skid Row. We&#8217;ll show you where Tom found his true love and collaborator, Kathleen Brennan, and how all the pieces came together to transform a drunken, desperate singer into the multi-faceted, multi-media artist he&#8217;d become.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; font-family: Arial, Geneva, Webdings, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-style: normal;\">Raised near San Diego, Tom Waits launched his musical career in L.A., signing with David Geffen&#8217;s Asylum Records in 1972, living at the raunchy Tropicana Hotel (where he sawed off the kitchen drain board so his piano would fit), and building a reputation as a songwriter willing to risk his own health and sanity to get inside the sad sack characters that peopled songs like &#8220;The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me),&#8221; &#8220;On The Nickel&#8221; and &#8220;Pasties And A G-string (At The Two O&#8217;clock Club).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; font-family: Arial, Geneva, Webdings, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-style: normal;\">By 1980, Tom was 31 and starting to feel the effects of his hard living. While scoring the music to Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s &#8220;One From The Heart,&#8221; he met Kathleen Brennan, whose influence would completely transform his life and his art. After a whirlwind courtship the pair married and began a 28-year creative and personal partnership, beginning with the revolutionary album &#8220;Swordfishtrombones,&#8221; the subject of tour host David Smay&#8217;s recent book.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; font-family: Arial, Geneva, Webdings, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-style: normal;\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; font-family: Arial, Geneva, Webdings, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-style: normal;\">&#8220;Crawling Down Cahuenga&#8221; spans Tom&#8217;s personal city, from The Nickel (aka Skid Row) to once-ratty West Hollywood, favorite strip clubs and midnight diners, recording studios, night clubs, record labels and film studios, before rolling back downtown via the filming location of Waits&#8217; &#8220;In The Neighborhood&#8221; video.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6em; font-family: Arial, Geneva, Webdings, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-style: normal;\">ABOUT THE HOSTS: Longtime collaborators David Smay and Kim Cooper co-edited the books &#8220;Bubblegum Music is the Naked Truth&#8221; (&#8220;quite simply the most fun music book I have ever read.&#8221; -Bucketfull of Brains) and &#8220;Lost in the Grooves: Scram&#8217;s Capricious Guide to the Music You Missed&#8221; (&#8220;the perfect book for the advanced record collector&#8221; -Ear Candy) before penning their solo 33 1\/3 series books on Tom Waits and Neutral Milk Hotel.
