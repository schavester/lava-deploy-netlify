During the Hellishly hot summer of 1985, when nightfall brought only sleepless fear, bloody nightmares, cold sweat, and doors and windows locked tight, Richard Ramirez, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Night Stalker,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d became a part of my psyche on many levels. Ramirez and I were born within two years of each other, and raised within a few blocks of each other in El Paso, Texas. Decades later, his path of death would cross my very own East Los Angeles neighborhood. We feared his shadow lurking on our streets, as mere minutes away, he prowled and killed in the neighboring cities of Monterey Park and Whittier. Richard Ramirez was the reason my parents installed security windows on our home. I often, unknowingly, surely crossed paths with Ramirez as we both frequented the same downtown L.A. locations within the very same time period. His capture within a few miles of my home involved friends I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve known for most of my life. My family and the rest of the city of L.A. experienced &#8220;The Night Stalker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s&#8221; terror during that blistering summer in 1985, and it seems that I have been formulating this tour ever since. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary of Richard Ramirez\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 capture, the time had come to stir the demons of the Night Stalker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s satanic legacy once more\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After the overwhelming response to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sold-out 25th Anniversary Night Stalker Tour, and having completed work this year as creative consultant for a U.K. documentary based on the life of Richard Ramirez, Al Guerrero will re-embark on a 2011 tour narrative based on extensive research and interviews with the principal players of &#8220;The Night Stalker&#8221; case, including the late author Philip Carlo, Homicide detective Gil Carrillo, indirect communication with Ramirez himself, and surprising new revelations from the residents of East L.A.&#8217;s Hubbard Street who were responsible for the killer&#8217;s capture.<\/p>\n<p>Tour guests will be chilled by the shadow of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Night Stalker\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as we explore one of the most horrifying and terror filled chapters in Los Angeles crime lore.<\/p>\n<p>For more info, visit this <a href=\"http:\/\/nightstalkertour.blogspot.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">link<\/a> or email nightstalkertourATgmailDOTcom<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the tour, Al Guerrero will give a short <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/salon811\" target=\"_blank\">LAVA Salon<\/a> presentation on &#8220;The Night Stalker&#8221; case and the experience of living through L.A.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153summer of fear.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Following the presentation, the tour will embark from Clifton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cafeteria after the 2 p.m. conclusion of LAVA Salon.
