In May, Denton disappeared. When his friends called, Louise claimed that Denton had gone into hiding after being disfigured in a sword fight. For months, she lived and entertained in Denton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mansion, until the police agreed to search the house. Denton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murdered body was discovered buried in the basement, but Louise Peete had flown the coop. Captured and tried, she was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in San Quentin. She served eighteen years, and was once again homeless. Good-hearted Margaret Logan offered Louise a position as paid companion and housekeeper. Five years later, Margaret vanished. Her body was discovered in the backyard of her Pacific Palisades home. Thanks to the forensic evidence gathered and interpreted by Ray Pinker, <span class=\"caps\">LAPD<\/span> chemist and future director of the <span class=\"caps\">CSULA<\/span> Criminalistics Department, Louise was found guilty of murder and executed in the California gas chamber in&nbsp;1947.<\/p>\n<p><em>Case Two<\/em>: The End of Charlie Crawford<\/p>\n<p>Charlie \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Gray Wolf\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Crawford and newspaper editor Hebert Spencer were shot, Spencer fatally, in Crawford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hollywood office on May 20, 1931.  The investigation and trials that followed are the stuff of Los Angeles legend. Crawford was a racketeer who was in with the crooked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153City Hall Crowd\u00e2\u20ac\u009d during Prohibition. He died in a hospital ward muttering with his last breath that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d take the name of his killer to his grave. Forensic investigators in the <span class=\"caps\">LAPD<\/span> went to work seeking the answer. Before they found it, David Clark, a former Assistant District Attorney and candidate for a municipal judgeship, walked into the Hall of Justice and confessed.  Homicide detectives were incredulous, and the forensic investigation continued.  The first trial resulted in a mistrial, the second in acquittal.  In his presentation, Deputy Frantantoni will walk us through the landmark forensic analysis and pull back the curtains on this rich and fascinating period of Los Angeles history, and a story so twisted, no less a noir master than Raymond Chandler fictionalized it.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1306\" data-postid=\"1306\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1306 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To purchase a ticket for this special event, click here.&nbsp;If you&#8217;d like to be contacted when another crime lab tour and lecture are scheduled, subscribe to LAVA&#8217;s occasional Crime Lab Newsletter.
