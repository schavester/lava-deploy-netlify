Not as a time machine per se, although photographs are invaluable as a means of preservation.When I say I use a photograph to suspend time I mean that a still photograph gives one the means to stop and immerse oneself in the physical and emotional responses that the image provokes. I find that the images I capture always speak to me on different levels, and the fact that they are still images provides me with the luxury to take the time necessary to let the emotions of curiosity, wonder, sadness, joy, and the other responses my pictures evoke, wash over me. I hope you enjoy my work, and that you find it provocative. My work has been exhibited in the Riverside Art Museum, the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, the Santa Fe Art Colony, the Palos Verdes Center for the Arts, and in numerous gallery shows and exhibits.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Open by appointment until March 5.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-83\" data-postid=\"83\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-83 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Color and black &amp; white photographs of the desert and downtown Los Angeles at night by fine art photographer Martin Waterman, who says this about his work:<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":26,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","amp_status":"","spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":""},"categories":[7],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p7lp7K-1l","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/83"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/26"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=83"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/83\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=83"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=83"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=83"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
