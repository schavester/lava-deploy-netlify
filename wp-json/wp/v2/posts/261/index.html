All interpretations and nuisances of the word fl\u00c3\u00a2neur are examined &#8212; from the modern-day aesthete dreaming of Baudelaire while carried along in the human tide past the stalls and shops of Broadway, to its more recent and perhaps relevant use, someone who is loitering. At its heart this series is a celebration of the simple act of getting out of your car and walking through a neighborhood and learning to see it with all your eyes.<\/p>\n<p>In this installment, we will visit <strong>Olvera Street<\/strong>, the historic seed of Los Angeles and the first place where issues of urban preservation entered the city&#8217;s consciousness. On this free 45-minute walking tour, we&#8217;ll explore the site&#8217;s history, from the founding of the city (1781) to the present day, with a focus on the &#8220;classic&#8221; era: Christine Sterling&#8217;s nearly thirty years of preservation and reinterpretation, which resulted in the entire Plaza becoming a State park, now managed by the city of Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p>On this informative stroll through a provocative and multi-layered space, we&#8217;ll explore such key questions as:<\/p>\n<p><em>* What core challenges, goals and strategies are shared by Christine Sterling at the Plaza in the early 20th century and the developers of downtown&#8217;s Old Bank District (4th &amp; Main) in the early 21st century?<\/p>\n<p>* Can arts and culture succeed as a tool for economic development for reinvigorating historic neighborhoods? &nbsp;Was Jane Jacobs right when she proclaimed that&nbsp; &#8220;new ideas need old buildings&#8221;?<\/p>\n<p>* Is there a point on the continuum where the creeping kitsch of a tourist attraction overwhelms the value of a vital community space? Can a positive public space be ruined by popularity and accessibility?<\/em>&nbsp; <\/p>\n<p>The 45-minute tour will be followed with a preview visit to downtown&#8217;s newest cultural institution, <a href=\"http:\/\/lapca.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes<\/a> in the old Brunswig Building just south of &#8220;La Placita&#8221; church. Here President and CEO <strong>Miguel Angel Corzo<\/strong> will give us a 30-minute walkthrough of the newly-refurbished site and touch on the core goals and objectives for the institution, which opens in the fall.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Space is very limited<\/strong> on this free walking tour, and each guest must sign up using their own name and email address&#8211;no plus ones can be accommodated.
