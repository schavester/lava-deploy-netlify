Get on the bus to see inside some of these legendary locales and find out where Night Stalker Richard Ramirez liked to stay and the hotel that saw a visit from the Skid Row Slasher, and where two traveling chocolate salesmen laughed so hard they fell backwards out a window to their deaths. You&#8217;ll also explore the fiery curse that repeatedly leveled the St. George Hotel. Included are some light hearted stories to help the blood and gore go down.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -1.5em; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; padding: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; text-indent: 1.5em; color: #333333; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: 0.540000021457672px; line-height: 28.7999992370605px;\">The Main Street Vice portion is a social history tour celebrating the ribald, racy, raunchy old promenade where the better people simply did not travel, but kicks were had by all who did. Burlesque babes and dirty picture parlors, mummified western outlaws and old time tattoo parlors, wax museums and pawn brokers, &#8220;professors&#8221; offering sex lectures and magazine peddlers with nudie Marilyn Monroe calendars under the counter, sophisticated steak houses and nickel donut dives &#8212; these were the pleasures and the people to be found along Main during the first half of the 20th century, a street that every Angeleno knew offered more (yet less) of what could be seen anywhere else. On this tour, we&#8217;ll visit the scenes of some more unforgettable debaucheries and share stories of crime, smut, passion and commerce.<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: -1.5em; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; padding: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; text-indent: 1.5em; color: #333333; font-family: 'Roboto Condensed', sans-serif; font-size: 18px; letter-spacing: 0.540000021457672px; line-height: 28.7999992370605px;\">Climb aboard for a time travel journey back to the downtown that&#8217;s not there anymore, and the surprising amount of gems that survive.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1413\" data-postid=\"1413\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1413 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From the founding of the city through the 1940s, downtown was the true center of Los Angeles, a lively, densely populated, exciting and sometimes dangerous place.
