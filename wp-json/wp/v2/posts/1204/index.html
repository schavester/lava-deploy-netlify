Zine Fest!<\/p>\n<p>Founded by music journalist and editor D. M. Collins (L.A. RECORD) in 2012 out of a sense of desperation, A Rrose in a Prose is a cure for the boring open-mic readings and pushy poetry slams you may have suffered through at coffee shops throughout the Southland. Featuring writers from all genres, and we mean all of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcem\u00e2\u20ac\u201dpoets, fiction writers, essayists, eroticists, educators, rappers, playwrights, political pundits, bards, braggarts, addicts, comedians, conspirators, and critics, to name a few\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand from all walks of life, A Rrose in a Prose\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand-picked, cross-pollinated, round-robin style readings are never dull, never safe, and might just help you find your next literary crush.<\/p>\n<p>This month, of course, the theme is zines.

We&#8217;re certain their stories, and of course their writings, will provide some laughter, some learning, and a sense of legacy for the crowd at Zine Fest.<\/p>\n<p>Now in its third year, L.A. Zine Fest is an annual gathering of zine makers, DIY publishers, graphic novelists and readers, the kind of festival that hits that sweet spot between \u00e2\u20ac\u0153convention\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153community.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d This year, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all coming coming together at Helm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bakery in Culver City, where over 175 exhibitors of zines and indie publications are scheduled to spread small press goodies across countless booths and blankets and tables for your perusal (and purchase)!<\/p>\n<p>There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also be a whole day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of presentations, readings, and events; Doors open at 10am, A Rrose in a Prose hits the main stage from 4:15 to 5 p.m.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1204\" data-postid=\"1204\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1204 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A Rrose in a Prose, L.A.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most ramshackle monthly literary salon, is pleased to announce that this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event will be something very special: a curated reading onstage at the 2014 L.A.
