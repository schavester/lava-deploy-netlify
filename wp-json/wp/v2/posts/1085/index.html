Largely anonymous, they were nevertheless held to be the remains of Early Christian martyrs, and treated as sacred. Sent to Catholic churches and religious houses in German-speaking Europe to replace holy relics that had been destroyed in the wake of the Protestant Reformation, the skeletons were carefully reassembled and richly adorned in jewels and precious costumes by teams of nuns. Intended as flamboyant devotional items, they also turned out to be the finest works of art ever created in human bone. Once part of the spiritual life of many people, as time passed the faith in these sumptuously decorated skeletons wavered, and they were cast out during the Enlightenment as remnants of a superstitious and embarrassing Catholic past. Largely forgotten in the annals of religious history, Dr. Koudounaris gained unprecedented access to religious institutions where the surviving decorated skeletons are held. His photographs are the first that were ever taken of many of them, and the images which will accompany his lecture are bizarre, moving, and beautiful.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Salon will be followed<em>&nbsp;<\/em>by a free tour of South Broadway&#8211;<a title=\"The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway Master Streetscape Walking Tour #3\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/flaneur-broadway-on-my-mind-3\" target=\"_blank\">The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway on My Mind walking tour #3<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1085\" data-postid=\"1085\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1085 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Join&nbsp;LAVA&nbsp;for our revived free monthly Sunday Salon series.
