He made a BBC film about the GB colony, he has been a radio host since the early 1980s ( KROQ, KCRW, KPCC) and now talks about his life here on his XM (Channel 152,Extreme Radio) and Luxuriamusic.com radio shows and also in his monthly &#8220;Letters From Lotusland&#8221; posted online. While online travel to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/ianwhitcomb\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube<\/a> and see Ian in his rock &nbsp;star splendor and go through the years with him as he transforms from rocker to ragtimer and finally to ukester&#8211;you can even watch the BBC documentary mentioned above&#8211;it&#8217;s heavy with sex and nudity) He will illustrate his ramble with extracts from his latest book, <a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/lavatransforms-20\/detail\/057803610X\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Letters From Lotusland&#8211;An Englishman In Exile&#8221;<\/a> (especially from the episode where his dog Rollo is taken for a ride by a Hollywood scam audition outfit ), and, with his ukulele he will sing his song , &#8220;Come And Make Your Heaven In L.A.&#8221; &nbsp;(as featured in the horrible slasher feature, &#8220;Bloody Movie&#8221; and on You Tube). Ian, by the way, was instrumental in the &nbsp;revival of the ukulele&#8211; back in the 1960s and early 70s on Dick Clark&#8217;s &#8220;Where The Action Is&#8221; and Johnny Carson&#8217;s &#8220;Tonight Show&#8221; and, of course, though his hit single <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=X8HDsWJilq8\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go With Friday On Saturday Night?&#8221;<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.5em; margin-left: 0px; font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;\"><strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-size: small; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;\">Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria is at 648 South Broadway, near the corner of 7th Street.
