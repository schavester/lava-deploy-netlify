Predicated on the three fundamentals: a universal Brotherhood, an infinite, unknowable universe, and the cyclic pilgrimage of the soul through a multitude of lifetimes steered by the laws of Karma, this challenging, complex and multidimensional path to spiritual devotion is exemplified in the tightly woven, rich text of the Gita&#8217;s 18 books. The Gita is a balm to the pilgrim&#8217;s weary journey.  This class, which is free and open to the public, meets every Wednesday at 1pm, and has been offered every week since 1915. &nbsp; The translation used is by William Q. Judge, a founder of the Theosophical Movement, and it is the relevance of the Gita to Theosophy&#8217;s fundamental principles with which the class discussion concerns itself.  The United Lodge of Theosophy in Los Angeles celebrated its 100 year anniversary in 2009, and has been in its current location since 1927.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;\">All are welcome to attend its classes without charge. This Lodge&#8217;s policy is &#8220;independent devotion to the cause of Theosophy without professing attachment to any Theosophical organization. It is loyal to the great Founders of the Theosophical Movement, but does not concern itself with dissensions or differences of individual opinion. The work it has on hand and the end it keeps in view are too absorbing and too lofty to leave it the time or inclination to take part in side issues.  That work and that end is the dissemination of the fundamental principles of the Philosophy of Theosophy, and the exemplification in practice of those principles, through a truer realization of the SELF; a profounder conviction of Universal Brotherhood.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1355\" data-postid=\"1355\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1355 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Bhagavad Gita, &#8220;Song Of God,&#8221; is a fundamental text in the Hindu Upanishads, and a cornerstone in the body of ancient and timeless works upon which the Theosophical Movement is built.
