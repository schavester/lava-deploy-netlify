With no help from the police, his parents searched the Alps looking for him. They found his car near the gondola station at the Stubai Glacier, a popular ski resort near Innsbruck, Austria.  The car had sat in the lot for six weeks without being reported. Fourteen years later, Duncan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body was found at the resort.<\/p>\n<p>What happened to Duncan MacPherson? In order to answer that question, true crime author John Leake sought the expertise of trace evidence examiner Lynne Herold, whom he knew had served as a key witness in the prosecution of international serial killer Jack Unterweger, the subject of John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s <a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/0425228010\" target=\"_blank\">first book<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Join John and Lynne as they team up a second time to solve the 22-year-old forensic mystery of Duncan MacPherson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappearance. Through presentation of physical evidence recovered from the scene, eyewitness testimony, chronology of events, additional evidentiary research and peculiar gaps in the forensic records, crime lab attendees will follow John through the steps by which he discovered a shocking cover up and the answers for which Duncan MacPherson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parents had been searching for more than a decade.<\/p>\n<p>Also featured at this special crime lab seminar is a discussion of John Leake\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first book, <em><a href=\"http:\/\/astore.amazon.com\/bubble1-20\/detail\/0425228010\" target=\"_blank\">Entering Hades: The Double Life of a Serial Killer<\/a>,<\/em> about the Austrian criminal Jack Unterweger.  Discover how Unterweger expanded his murderous activities from Europe to Los Angeles and put himself squarely in the crosshairs of trace evidence expert Lynne Herold. Of her testimony at Unterweger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Austrian trial, his attorney stated \u00e2\u20ac\u009d[she] was the most impressive expert witness. When she started talking about the ligatures, I could see the jury looking at Unterweger in a darker light, and I knew then that we were in big trouble.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Join us as John and Lynne discuss the ligature evidence from Jack Unterweger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last trial, and how an international team of forensic scientists finally put an end to a deadly career.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Biographies<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p>Born in Dallas, Texas, JOHN LEAKE went to Vienna, Austria on a graduate school scholarship and ended up living in the city for over a decade, working as a freelance writer and translator.
