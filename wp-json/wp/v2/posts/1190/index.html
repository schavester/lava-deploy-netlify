The story might have followed that oft-told American tale of opportunity for all, but like all good Hollywood scripts, the tale of Clark Rockefeller had a dark twist. Namely murder.<\/p>\n<p>In April 2013, Rockefeller, whose real name is Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, was convicted in the 1985 slaying of John Sohus. Gerhartsreiter didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t only kill Sohus, he buried the trisected body in the backyard of a home in San Marino \u00e2\u20ac\u201d one of L.A. wealthiest neighborhoods. And then he vanished along with Sohus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 new wife Linda, a 6-foot, 200-pound, red-headed Amazon with a flair for dark science fiction and strange fantasy.<\/p>\n<p>He may have left San Marino, but Gerhartsreiter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quest to become a member of wealthy and privileged American society continued. During the height of the Reagan Administration he worked under the assumed name of Christopher Crowe as a broker for some of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toniest firms. When the cops came looking for him, Crowe became Rockefeller and embarked upon one of the greatest cons ever pulled on high society. As Rockefeller, the onetime immigrant had a pad down the street from the United Nations. He hobnobbed with celebrities, collected art and bragged about his dogs.<\/p>\n<p>Rockefeller eventually married Sandy Boss, a respected financial analyst with a seven-figure annual income. But when the couple got divorced and Clark kidnapped their daughter, the past came knocking.<\/p>\n<p>The murder case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence that singularly might not have amounted to a conviction. Taken together the evidence, which included blood, fingerprints, old ID cards and a stolen car, was solid. What resulted in the conviction? Probably a simple light shone on a plastic bag sold in a university bookstore for a very limited period of time. The man once known as Rockefeller is now simply Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, 52, a resident of a medium security prison in the San Joaquin Valley serving out a 25-to-life sentence for killing John Sohus.<\/p>\n<p>As for Linda? She has never resurfaced.<\/p>\n<p>For Frank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second lecture, he will lower his guard, roll up his sleeves, and look back on three decades in the newspaper business reporting on criminal investigations and the law enforcement agencies which conduct them, distilling for us the best and the worst, like how a murderous tagger might as well have signed his name at the crime scene, or the paramedics who left brain matter on a dead man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driveway for his family to clean up, or a con-man who used Craigslist to bilk dozens of needy would-be renters, and what still keeps him up at night: an unsolved double murder in Monrovia that occurred during a ride-along in the 1990s.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 0.5;\">ABOUT FRANK GIRARDOT:&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: .5;\">Frank Girardot is the editor of the <\/span><em>Pasadena Star-News<\/em><span style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 1.5;\">.
