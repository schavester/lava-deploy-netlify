The screening is in conjunction with a new series of downtown stories on the In SRO Land time travel blog, <a href=\"http:\/\/insroland.org\/urmposts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">featuring material<\/a> from the Union Rescue Mission Archives.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>ABOUT THE FILM<\/strong>: In mid-1948 the Board of Directors of the <a href=\"http:\/\/urm.org\/\"><span class=\"s1\">Union Rescue Mission<\/span><\/a> approved the expenditure of $5,000 to make the 30-minute film <span class=\"s2\"><em>Of Scrap &amp; Steel<\/em> <\/span>which portrays the redemption and good works of Arthur Hawkins, an alcoholic executive who ended up on the streets of Los Angeles and whose life was saved when he turned to the URM for help. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0356004\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Porter Hall<\/a> (Arthur Hawkins) is one of only two actors in a film otherwise populated by real Los Angeles characters. (You may recall Hall&#8217;s performance as the pesky guy on the train in <em>Double Indemnity<\/em>.)&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><em>Of Scrap &amp; Steel<\/em>&nbsp;<\/span> was only shown in screenings organized by the URM or related organizations, and would have been completely lost if Liz Mooradian, URM historian, had not saved a deteriorating 16mm print and had it transferred to video before it was too late. <span class=\"s2\"><em>Of Scrap &amp; Steel<\/em> <\/span>is just one of the remarkable artifacts discovered in the Union Rescue Mission archives and <a href=\"http:\/\/insroland.org\/urmposts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">explored<\/a> in the In SRO Land blog.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">This entertaining and powerful short film is a compelling snapshot of life on Skid Row (Main Street) circa 1949, and a fascinating document of the important work that the URM continues to do with the most needy in the community. Although downtown Los Angeles features in numerous noir films, it is extremely rare to see color images of eastern downtown, and rarer still to see full-color live-action footage of the vibrant street scene that included rescue missions, pawn shops, amusement parlors, bars, restaurants and the ever-patrolling paddy wagon in search of drunkards to haul away to jail or County work crews.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">This free rooftop screening is jointly organized by LAVA &#8211; The Los Angeles Visionaries Association, the <a href=\"http:\/\/insroland.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In SRO Land<\/a> time travel blog and the <a href=\"http:\/\/urm.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Union Rescue Mission<\/a>. Seating will be provided, and attendees are encouraged to dress warmly for the cool night air.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>Gourmet box dinners<\/strong>: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Meals with a purpose\u00e2\u20ac\u009d will be available for purchase ($7, cash only), with a choice of sandwich (vegetarian, roast beef or chicken), cookie, fruit, chips and beverage. 100% of proceeds from your meal donation goes to the URM, and the proceeds from each dinner will feed two other people.<\/p>\n<p>This screening is held in conjunction with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/urmwalk2\">Skid Row Walking Tour<\/a>, a separate free event beginning two hours before the screening.  Separate registration for each event is required if you wish to attend both the screening and walking tour.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Nearest Metro station<\/strong> is <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Little_Tokyo_\/_Arts_District_%28Los_Angeles_Metro_station%29\">Little Tokyo<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>Limited free parking<\/strong> is available at the URM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s underground parking lot.
