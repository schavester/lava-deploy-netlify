Since then he has had a very exciting career both as a cop and as an instructor. After serving his community on patrol for the better part of six years, he was promoted to the rank of detective and went to the homicide detail. During his tenure, he investigated approximately 200 murders, officer involved shootings, suspicious deaths and other special investigations including but not limited to political corruption cases.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">During his tenure in the homicide bureau, he worked diligently to hone his skills as an interrogator, eventually becoming the department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s instructor for Interview and Interrogation. After a short time teaching the course, his reputation as a dynamic instructor generated a waiting list for his courses. Seeing the need for a more comprehensive homicide school for new detectives, Derek wrote and implemented California&#8217;s first ever 80-hour homicide school. Currently it is the only course of it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind in the United States.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">!<\/span>With the popularity of his course material and his presentation style, Derek started receiving out of area and out of state requests for his lectures.
