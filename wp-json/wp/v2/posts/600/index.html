She has taught sculpture and drawing, exhibited both in solo and group shows, and completed a few large-scale sculpture commissions. She has done several unique performance pieces at various venues in southern California. Dakin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most well known work was a year-long performance campaign around the United States as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An Artist for President\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in 1983-84, in which she advanced the idea that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Nation is the art work and we the people are the artists.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d The book about that campaign, as timely today as it was then, is being published in fall 2011.
