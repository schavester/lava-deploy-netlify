It&#8217;s the second installment in my Opulent Mobility series and includes a tasseled cushion and parasol, a chafing dish nestling a GPS unit and cow horns in front. Oh, and a bud vase. You may have to look at the pictures.<\/p>\n<p>I worked on Diavolo&#8217;s adaptation of <em>Fearful Symmetries<\/em> on and off from June through September, but Aug-Sept were the push times since the show opened at the Bowl on September 9th. Naturally, my completed submission of the Steamwalker for the <em>Steampunk Form and Function<\/em> design competition was due Sept. 4th and the walker needed to be ready to ship out to Massachusetts before I left for Kansas City on Sept. 29th. Did I mention that August was also filled with finishing crafts for <em>Toy Story on Ice<\/em> and September was also devoted to prepping patterns (with designer Michael Schmidt) for Steven Tyler&#8217;s debut on <em>American Idol?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Got to pay the bills somehow.<\/p>\n<p>At any rate, <em>Toy Story<\/em> is now <em>on Ice.<\/em> Steve Tyler hasn&#8217;t yet worn anything I&#8217;ve made on <em>American Idol,<\/em> but it will happen.
