This Esotouric  bus adventure is hosted by Richard Schave.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Haunts of a Dirty Old Man: Charles Bukowski&#8217;s LA&#8221; spans Bukowski&#8217;s  personal city, from Skid Row to once-genteel Crown Hill, to Bukowski&#8217;s  favorite East Hollywood liquor store, the Pink Elephant.<\/p>\n<p>Esotouric has made its name with true crime bus tours (Black Dahlia,  Pasadena Confidential) and explorations of literary LA (Raymond  Chandler, John Fante, James M. Cain). Now they turn their creative  attentions to Bukowski, the prolific poet, novelist and screenwriter  whose rough-hewn tales of boozing, wild women and rotten jobs never  obscure the deep vein of sweetness and hope that runs through all his  work. In one of his finest poems, he described this as a bluebird he  kept caged, and that bluebird is been represented in the Bukbird, a pale  blue version of his beloved alcoholic crow character, represented by a  logo created by cartoonist Tony Millionaire exclusively for this tour.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-376\" data-postid=\"376\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-376 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This tour focuses on Bukowski\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great passions: writing, screwing and Los Angeles.
