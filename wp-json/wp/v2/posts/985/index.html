It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Los Angeles version of Gertrude Stein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1920s &#8220;Left Bank Salon&#8221; in Paris where she hosted luminaries like Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sinclair Lewis, Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. The play, as a staged reading, showcases L.A.&#8217;s own 1930s salon of gifted writers set in Stanley Rose&#8217;s Book Store, one door east of the Musso &amp; Frank Grill and across from the Brown Derby in Hollywood. The world premiere production will be presented as a benefit for the Friends of the Altadena Public Library in association with The Moveable Theatre Company, which uses volunteer professional actors. The performance is Sunday, May 5, 2013 at 3:00 PM in the Altadena Public Library community room in Altadena, California.

This is where Rose&#8217;s successful friends talked, drank, played cards and discussed ideas which would inspire their most famous works. The scene was like a &#8220;Who&#8217;s Who&#8221; of the Los Angeles literary scene during Hollywood&#8217;s Golden Age.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\">For example, William Saroyan wrote the Pulitzer Prize wining play, &#8220;The Time of Your Life.&#8221; John Fante, a novelist, wrote &#8220;Ask the Dust&#8221; among others and Nathanael West wrote bitter, satirical novels like &#8220;Day of the Locust.&#8221; Carey McWilliams, an attorney and &#8220;muckraker,&#8221; wrote works including &#8220;Factories in the Fields&#8221; and one of the finest histories of Southern California.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\"><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12.222222328186035px; line-height: 1.5;\">The play paints the picture of the bookstore&#8217;s backroom which was an &#8220;art gallery&#8221; (original Picassos), but retained the intimate atmosphere of the old speakeasy days. Bookstore owner, Stanley Rose, was characterized by playwright Peter Adum: &#8220;He was quite unique. Here was a hard-drinking, semi-literate, bootlegger who fed, nurtured and encouraged the writers who became his best friends. He wasn&#8217;t Gertrude Stein, but he was very much the &#8216;den mother&#8217;.&#8221; &nbsp;One of Rose&#8217;s lines in the play says a lot: &#8220;I sell books. I don&#8217;t read the damn things\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-985\" data-postid=\"985\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-985 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>REVEALING PLAY CAPTURES TRUE STORES ABOUT HOLLYWOOD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S &#8220;BACKROOM BOYS&#8221; &#8220;\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a brilliant play.
