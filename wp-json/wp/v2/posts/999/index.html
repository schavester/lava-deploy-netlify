Scott Smith describes the origins and creative process behind his <em>29 Palms<\/em> project. After the talk, join Scott for a pop-up gallery show featuring one or two full-scale finished works (3\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 x 5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) along with a few smaller sized pieces (18.5\u00e2\u20ac\u009d x 30\u00e2\u20ac\u009d) on display in the mezzanine.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Statement<\/em>:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><em>29 Palms<\/em> is a mirage of sorts, a photographic re-imagining of the original oasis of twenty-nine native palms around which the desert city of the same name developed. <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Washingtonia_filifera\" target=\"blank\">Washingtonia filifera<\/a>, the Golden State\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only indigenous palm, is featured in this collection alongside a remarkable variety of geographic transplants that flourish in Southern California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benign climate. Captured with a large format view camera on 8 \u00c3\u2014 10\u00e2\u20ac\u009d film and rendered in high-resolution 38 \u00c3\u2014 60\u00e2\u20ac\u009d chromogenic prints, the <em>29 Palms<\/em> series is both a typological study of individual palm trunks and a shimmering reflection of the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ethnically diverse human population.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>I became aware of the extraordinary beauty of palm trunks when my beloved dog began to slow in his old age. Walking through a Santa Monica park lined with palms, I confronted their trunks at close range while Buck lingered and sniffed around the bases. Their intricate patterns evoked abstract landscapes and I resolved to create formal portraits by visually severing the columnar trunks from crown and base. I developed a fascination with the history of Southern California\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s iconic palms and sought out both typical and unique specimens in public and private spaces.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/jscottsmithphotography.com\/J.%20Scott%20Smith%2029%20Palms.html\" target=\"blank\">J.

Have you ever wished you could have been there to see it?<\/p>\n<p>Well, our speaker, Gordon Pattison, can tell you and show you because he and his family lived there. The Pattison family owned the Castle and Salt Box, among others of the old Victorian buildings that were once there. Gordon will tell the story of Bunker Hill from a personal perspective, through recollections inspired from historical photographs of Bunker Hill as well as family photos taken there in the 1930s and 1940s.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/onbunkerhill.org\/georgemannshop\" target=\"blank\">Old Bunker Hill<\/a> isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t gone.
