If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in joining LAVA as a creative contributor or an attendee, we recommend Salon attendance as an introduction to this growing community. We also recommend the eclairs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;\">Read about the original Sunday Salon at Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/cliftonsalons\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;\">Because of the scope and scale of the program, this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sunday Salon will not follow our usual varied two-act structure, but will focus almost entirely on Electronic Music. The program will include the history of the genre, some theoretical discussion, a performance and a hands-on demonstration. We will break for about ten minutes about an hour into the presentation. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;\">Our focus is on Electronic Music, and the sub-genre known as <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Circuit_bending\" target=\"_blank\">Circuit Bending<\/a>. Circuit Bending is the creative rewiring of pre-existing circuits to make new media. Often these circuits are found in inexpensive children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toys and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153obsolete\u00e2\u20ac\u009d devices. Important aspects of Circuit Bending are the D.I.Y (Do It Yourself) autodidactic nature of immediate exploration into new electronic sounds and the ability to engage in instrument building without the need for an electrical engineering degree. The artists presenting today, <a href=\"http:\/\/andyben.com\/music\/music.html\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Ben<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/circuitryandpoetry.com\/aboutus\/AboutUs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Boynton<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/circuitryandpoetry.com\/aboutus\/AboutUs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mona Jean Cedar<\/a>, explore the implications of Circuit Bending through a variety of contexts, including performance, documentary video and education.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;\">For Mona Jean Cedar (poet, dancer and sign language interpreter) and Jeff Boynton (electronic musician), \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Circuitry and Poetry\u00e2\u20ac\u009d arose out of a desire to create collaborative artwork. Jeff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial impulse was to create interactive electronic instruments that would respond to Mona\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand and body movements. This did not happen immediately due to the steep learning curve of electronics, but it led to the discovery of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black art\u00e2\u20ac\u009d of Circuit Bending. This was the jumping off point, and eventually Jeff was able to develop interfaces that would allow Circuit Bent instruments to respond to light, sound and movement. Mona had already been creating work in which poetry and movement was composed specifically for how well they will work with sign language. Presenter Andy Ben is a musician and technologist and film maker who is interested in the digital convergence and post consumer culture.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;\">The <span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span> Sunday Salon will also feature a short presentation by the scholar and writer <a href=\"http:\/\/lareviewofbooks.org\/contributor\/fanny-daubigny\" target=\"_blank\">Fanny Daubigny<\/a> about the American translator <a href=\"http:\/\/ndbooks.com\/author\/louise-varese\" target=\"_blank\">Louise Var\u00c3\u00a8se<\/a> and her work with 19th century French poetry. (Louise Var\u00c3\u00a8se was the wife of <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Edgard_Var%C3%A8se\" target=\"_blank\">Edgar Var\u00c3\u00a8se<\/a>, whose compositions are considered a cornerstone of electronic music.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; text-justify: newspaper;\">The Salon will be followed by a free walking tour,&nbsp;<a title=\"The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway Master Streetscape Walking Tour #9\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lavatransforms.local\/flaneur-broadway-on-my-mind-9\" target=\"_blank\">The Flaneur &amp; The City: Broadway on My Mind walking tour #9<\/a>.
