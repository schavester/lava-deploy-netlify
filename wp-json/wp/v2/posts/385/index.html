Follow Sean on a voyage back to the old  neighborhood, to find out if you really can&#8217;t go home again, and what  happens when you try.<\/p>\n<p>Sean&#8217;s and Richard&#8217;s tour is a quick score of reds and ripple, or  maybe a bennie and a toke. We&#8217;ll roll down Whittier Boulevard, the  Chicano Sunset Strip, where hustlers once roamed the sidewalks to the  beat of Thee Midnighters blaring from hundreds of tricked-out rides, to  the history-drenched intersection of Brooklyn (aka Cesar Chavez) &amp;  Soto, which has been spilling out of its top and up over its jeans for  generations.  This eternal community hot spot teems with the ghosts of  Wobblies, Brown Berets, celebrated muralists, political activists and a  pre-teen Mickey Cohen shaking down customers to buy his newspapers, and  it&#8217;s just one of the powerful sites on this tour of a neighborhood whose  legends are too often oral, and whose heroes slip too easily into  obscurity. We&#8217;re pulling out the memory maps to spread tales that  deserve a wider audience.<\/p>\n<p>Over the decades the place has changed a lot, so we tackle the  elusive question: What&#8217;s the measure of a neighborhood?  In 1947, deli  man Ben Canter declared it was pickled beef, bragging that his Boyle  Heights restaurant produced 7,000 pounds of pastrami monthly (while his  upstart cousin on Fairfax moved scarcely half that).  Masa is now the  index for the community, and steamy tamales are comfort food for a whole  new generation of Eastsiders.<\/p>\n<p>Moratorium, blowouts, Ruben Salazar, Aida Handler (suspended from  Roosevelt High in 1931 for &#8220;un-American&#8221; activities), Msgr. Ramon  Garcia, All Nations Cultural Center, schmaltz (chicken fat) and schmeck  (heroin), knishes to menudo, shortdogs of T-bird wine and the bottle of  Manischewitz mama kept for company, from the sacred and the sacrilegious  everything is fair game and given in the spirit of &#8220;con safos&#8221; (that  means with respect, ese).<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a journey from innocence to experience, with a focus on the  ever-evolving quest for authenticity, and a myriad of political  upheavals and social changes which have played out over the generations.  It&#8217;s the Eastside as you&#8217;ve never seen it before, and a very special  Esotouric bus adventure recommended for anyone with a passion for Los  Angeles, and a thirst for the unheard stories of the city.<\/p>\n<p>The tour begins with special guest Michael Risner, who will give a  show and tell presentation on the archives of a local Boyle  Heights-based Japanese-American photographer which he accidentally  rescued from Craigslist and certain destruction. There are well over  100,000 individual photographs in this rescued archive, with images from  weddings to funerals, baby portraits to community events. Risner will  explain his plans for preserving and displaying the archive while  showing off some highlights from the collection. To learn more about  Michael&#8217;s discovery, see this L.A.
