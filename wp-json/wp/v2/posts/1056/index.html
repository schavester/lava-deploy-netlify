This new department allowed future investigators to maximize efficiency by pooling resources for evidence gathering and analysis, often using the forensic skills of contract chemist Arthur Mass.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">ABOUT<\/span> <span class=\"caps\">THE<\/span> <span class=\"caps\">CASE<\/span>:<br \/> James Watson married at least 18 women throughout the United States, several simultaneously. He placed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lonely hearts\u00e2\u20ac\u009d personal ads in newspapers which read:<\/p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153A gentleman, neat appearing, of courteous disposition, well connected in a business way; has quite a little property, and is connected with several corporations. Has a nice bank account as well as a considerable roll of government bonds. Would be pleased to correspond with refined young lady or widow. Object, matrimony. This advertisement is in good faith. All answers will be treated with respect.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/p>\n<p>There was no shortage of lonely women who took the bait and accepted the lie that he had to travel frequently for his work in the U.S. Secret Service. He targeted wealthy women, took control of their finances, and killed at least seven\u00e2\u20ac\u201dperhaps as many as fifteen.<\/p>\n<p>If it were not for the suspicions of his final wife, Kathryn, and the insight and tenacity of the <span class=\"caps\">LASD<\/span> investigators Bell and Couts, District Attorney Thomas L. Woolwine simply would have had nothing more on James Watson than a case of polygamy to take to a judge. Instead, Watson made a deal on the multiple murders, led investigators to a shallow grave, and was sentenced to life in prison.<\/p>\n<p><em>Presentation Two:<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Meiling Cabral, Chair of the California Association of Criminalists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Historical Committee, and a forensic investigator for the <span class=\"caps\">LAPD<\/span>, will present on three defining <span class=\"caps\">LAPD<\/span> and <span class=\"caps\">LASD<\/span> cases that influenced the development of modern forensic investigation. Meiling combines a practicing forensic scientist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience and an historian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s passion for reconstructing the past, to bring to life the legendary Los Angeles investigators who invented the field. Looming above them all is the <span class=\"caps\">LAPD<\/span>\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ray Pinker, who would go on to found the <span class=\"caps\">CSULA<\/span> Criminalistics Department, the site of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seminar. Vintage forensic collection kits will be available for viewing between presentations.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">ABOUT<\/span> <span class=\"caps\">THE<\/span> <span class=\"caps\">CASES<\/span>:<br \/> Featured cases are the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.1947project.com\/tags\/marion-parker\" target=\"_blank\">Marion Parker<\/a> kidnap slaying (1927), the <a href=\"http:\/\/infoczarina.blogspot.com\/2008\/12\/wineville-chicken-coop-murders.html\" target=\"_blank\">Wineville chicken coop murders<\/a> (1928) and the <a href=\"http:\/\/esotouric.com\/blackdahlia\" target=\"_blank\">Black Dahlia<\/a> murder (1947). Fingerprints played an important role in both the Marion Parker and Black Dahlia cases. <span class=\"caps\">LAPD<\/span> Captain H.L. Barlow, the forensic investigator on the Parker case, was so famous that he later sold his namesake fingerprint kit through ads in the back of detective magazines. The story of how <span class=\"caps\">LAPD<\/span> homicide detectives Harry Hansen and Finis Brown accessed cutting edge telephony to rush the fingerprints of the unidentified Black Dahlia victim to the <span class=\"caps\">FBI<\/span> for identification is as riveting today as it was when it made headlines. The death penalty case against Gordon Stewart Northcott, the Wineville boy killer, was based entirely on trace evidence: hair and fiber gathered&nbsp;at his murder ranch.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-1056\" data-postid=\"1056\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-1056 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To purchase a ticket for this special event, click here.&nbsp;If you&#8217;d like to be contacted when another crime lab tour and lecture are scheduled, subscribe to LAVA&#8217;s occasional Crime Lab Newsletter.
