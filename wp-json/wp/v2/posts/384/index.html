The  dream manifests at the turn of the 20th century as we explore how the  climate was sold, the growth of the citrus industry and Tuberculosis  hospitals. Then come the programmatic roadside architecture of the 1920s  and 1930s and postwar V-8 visions fueled by gasoline and good climate  (too bad you can&#8217;t run an engine on it).<\/p>\n<p>The Reyner Banham tour series is dedicated to revealing greater  L.A.&#8217;s infrastructure, history, the built and natural environment,  transportation corridors, drive-ins, attractions and oddities.<\/p>\n<p>This tour will focus on the built environment along the Mother Road  with an emphasis on old and historic alignments of Route 66 as well as  signage.<\/p>\n<p>Highlights of the Route 66 tour include:<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.waldoward.com\/\">E. Wald Ward Farm<\/a><\/strong>.    Purveyors of fine preservatives and other delicacies.  We will visit  the barn store of this venerable Sierra Madre citrus family which has  been in business of producing and selling the highest quality preserves  from their orchards since 1918.  We will tour the orchard and hear more  about the history of this family from 4th generation member, Jeff Ward.   Please peruse their <a href=\"http:\/\/ia341340.us.archive.org\/2\/items\/WaldoWardPriceList2010\/waldoWardPrice2010.pdf\">price list<\/a> and call ahead with your order!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Aztec Hotel<\/strong>. Though really Mayan in decoration, this  1924 Robert Stacy Judd-designed gem in the San Gabriel Valley&#8217;s crown  is becoming the place again to get your kicks.  Judd&#8217;s buildings in  Southern California were an important influence on Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s  Mayan houses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The McNeil &amp; Vosberg Residences (The Feuding Slauson Sisters of Azusa)<\/strong>.   A hidden gem of Azusa lore, and family dynamics.  It also serves as a  reminder of the fragility of ecologies to the incessant crush of  progress.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.esotouric.com\/fairmount\">Fairmount Cemetery<\/a><\/strong>, a remote and fascinating Civil War-era hillside burial ground.<\/p>\n<p>This four hour tour will include a complimentary coffee and cookies  stop in the early afternoon.  We recommend bringing a sandwich from  Clifton&#8217;s or a bag lunch as well. Please note: comfortable walking shoes  recommended. One of our shorter tour stops takes us over slightly  rugged ground, and less agile passengers may prefer to remain on the  bus.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-384\" data-postid=\"384\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-384 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Esotouric\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Reyner Banham Loves Los Angeles\u00e2\u20ac\u009d tours each explore themes of industry, infrastructure, architecture and the built environment.
