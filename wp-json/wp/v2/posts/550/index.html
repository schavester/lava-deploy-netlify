This is the first book to bring together the world&#8217;s most important charnel sites, ranging from the crypts of the Capuchin monasteries in Italy and the skull-encrusted columns of the ossuary in \u00c3\u2030vora in Portugal, to the strange tomb of a 1960s wealthy Peruvian nobleman decorated with the exhumed skeletons of his Spanish ancestors. Illustrated with specially taken photographs of sites rarely open to the public and forgotten archive images of others long destroyed, this mesmerising, shocking and deeply moving book is an essential memento mori for our modern age.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-550\" data-postid=\"550\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-550 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Los Angeles art historian and author&nbsp;Paul Koudounaris&nbsp;presents his new publication,&nbsp;The Empire of Death: A Cultural History of Ossuaries and Charnel Houses&nbsp;(Thames &amp; Hudson, October 2011).&nbsp;Question and answer and discussion afterward.
