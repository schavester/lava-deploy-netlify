With <strong>SEE YOU IN 100 YEARS,<\/strong> you can participate in an attempt to recreate the Houdini Experiment using an Internet Time Capsule. Is there an after life? Harry Houdini had the same question. He even had a secret pass code with his beloved wife. A message sent from beyond to say &#8220;I&#8217;m here.&#8221; In the spirit of Houdini, GHOULA will pay homage to this experiment in a grand scale by creating a modern time capsule, documenting participants, digitally recording their secret pass codes, and then archiving the time capsule for one hundred years. Detailed instructions will be left in the hands of a respected institution. At the end of the hundred years a non-affiliated caretaker of the project will be selected to devise a team of mediums, psychics, and scientists to reach out to the time capsule participants (that&#8217;s YOU!).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Clifton&#8217;s Cafeteria is at 648 South Broadway, near the corner of 7th Street.
