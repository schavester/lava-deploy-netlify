It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also home to fascinating people, places and happenings. But these wonders are dotted over a vast and confusing landscape, drowned out by media blare and corporate blather.

We take the image of <span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span>, the molten rock cast up from the underworld, from the ancient Sankaya Hindu doctrine, which is that of polar opposites driving the world. A ball of lava contains fire and iron in a highly dynamic situation, very close but never mixing. We also see <span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span> as reflecting all of the tightly coiled, passionate energy that exists in various places and minds within the city: each <span class=\"caps\">LAVA<\/span> event provides an opportunity to tap into a well of ideas that in emerging transforms the city and the people who share in the experience.<\/p>\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-4559\" data-postid=\"4559\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-4559 themify_builder\">\n    <\/div>\n<!-- \/themify_builder_content -->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to LAVA, the Los Angeles Visionaries Association.
