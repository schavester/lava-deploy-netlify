<p>Turning the predictable idea of a Los Angeles architecture tour on its head, this excursion goes into areas not traditionally associated with the important, beautiful or significant, raising issues of preservation, adaptive reuse and urban planning. The locations all speak to the power, mutability and reach of Southern California as a creative engine. </p>
<p>Some of the tour stops are:</p>
<h2 id="canninghardwareandtheedbigdaddyrothstudio">Canning Hardware and the Ed &#8220;Big Daddy&#8221; Roth studio</h2>
<p>In the 1950s, this modest stretch of Slauson Avenue was ground zero for Southern California high performance and hot rod culture. Here weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll show how aerospace, social mobility and teenage ingenuity transformed the automotive industry and created new modes of self-expression that  would have an international influence.</p>
<h2 id="casaderanchosanantoniohenrygagemansion">Casa de Rancho San Antonio / Henry Gage Mansion</h2>
<p>One of the oldest adobe structures in Los Angeles County (built c.1840), this Bell Gardens landmark was built by the Lugo family, whose land holdings spread into the city of South Gate, named for the propertyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s southern border. This fascinating residence  on the banks of the Rio Hondo River is now entirely surrounded by a mid-century trailer park. Between the layers of historical context are revealed the history of local migration and population growth, from Spanish land grants to the dust bowl to the vast waves of subdivided suburbs. From a public space outside the property, tour host Richard Schave will share the strange tale of the seldom seen mansion, and his years-long efforts to make this California landmark accessible to the public.</p>
<h2 id="mcdonaldsfranchise2downey">McDonaldâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Franchise #2, Downey</h2>
<p>The platonic ideal of a Google-style roadside hamburger stand and the oldest McDonaldâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s franchise still standing, this National Register landmark sports several unique features: integrated golden arches framing Stanley Mestonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s classic walk-up restaurant design, an enormous neon Speedee character sign, and deep fried apple pie still available for your noshing pleasure. The story of why there is a McDonaldâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s on this particular corner and how it still looks so cool will amaze you. </p>
<h2 id="downeyhighschoolcarpentersapartments">Downey High School &amp; Carpenters Apartments</h2>
<p>A musical interlude to highlight the hit parading pride of Downey, Richard &amp; Karen Carpenter of The Carpenters and their deep community roots. Growing up steeped in the space race that was run in their backyard, theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll go on to produce one of the greatest UFO-themed singles ever, &#8220;Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft,&#8221; and invest in a charming set of 1970s multi-family real estate still decorated with pop star branding.  </p>
<h2 id="columbiamemorialspacecenter">Columbia Memorial Space Center</h2>
<p>Recently erected on the edge of the former Downey Space Plant facility, an aerospace landmark that was demolished for redevelopment as a mall, this museum and gift shop serves as a base for understanding the vast infrastructure and industry that was the engine that powered the space race, and radically transformed Southern California culture.</p>
<h2 id="harveysbroilerdowney">Harveyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Broiler, Downey</h2>
<p>Harveyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s was a glowing stop on the mid-century South Los Angeles teenage car cruising circuit, its international influence on fashion, design and pop culture immortalized by Tom Wolfe in his essay &#8220;The Hair Boys.&#8221; That would be enough to grant Harveyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a spot on this tour. But Harveyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s is also a landmark of historic preservation activism. After a section of the beloved drive-in was illegally demolished by a tenant, the community demanded it be rebuilt exactly as it had been, holding their elected officials accountable to ensure that happened. Today, itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a Bobâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Big Boy restaurant, still a favorite stop for cruisers, families and preservation people who need a little boost in the throes of a tough campaign. If Harveyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s can come back, so can <strong><em>_</em></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="housingofmedicalemergencieshomefacilityatrancholosamigossoutherncampuslosangelescountypoorfarm">Housing of Medical Emergencies (H.O.M.E.) facility at Rancho Los Amigos Southern Campus / Los Angeles County Poor Farm</h2>
<p>This enormous compound was originally known as the Los Angeles County Poor Farm, established in 1888 as a rehabilitation facility providing work, housing and medical care for the indigent. The period of greatest construction was the 1920s, with notable structures in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. The now-vacant historic buildings are unfortunately popular with trespassing &#8220;urban explorers&#8221; and ghost hunters, which may explain several recent major fires. The south side of the old campus is slated for redevelopment, a project which is expected to include the preservation and adaptive reuse of some of the historic structures. In the midst of the southern campus, The Assistance League of Downey in 1997 established the Housing of Medical Emergencies (H.O.M.E.) facility, a 10-unit apartment complex which provides temporary, low-cost housing to families who have loved ones rehabilitating at the adjacent Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center, on what was the north side of the Poor Farm. During this stop, we will pay a visit to H.O.M.E. and enjoy perimeter views of the remaining historic structures on the southern campus of the old Poor Farm.</p>
<p>This tour is just one of Esotouric&#8217;sÂ <a href="https://esotouric.com/southla/californiaculture">California Culture tour series</a> (formerly known as the Reyner Banham Loves L.A. series).</p>

What the Lowdown on Downtown is, is a deeply researched â€œwarts and allâ€ history, with a focus on urban redevelopment, public policy, protest and political power.</p>
<p>It is the revealing tale of how the New Downtown became an â€œovernight sensationâ€ after decades of behind the scenes work by public agencies and private developers. This complicated story will fascinate and infuriate, break your heart and thrill your spirit. So get on the bus for the real Lowdown on Downtown, as no one but Esotouricâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Richard Schave, also the founding director of the Downtown L.A. Art Walk, can reveal it. Our tour begins in the corporate public spaces of Bunker Hill and Pershing Square, each the result of deliberate social engineering. Bunker Hillâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s redevelopment displaced 9,000 people, the largest eminent domain land seizure in American history.</p>
<p>Down the hill, we find the formerly positive public space of Pershing Square paved over, rendering downtownâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s â€œliving roomâ€ into a place where even the indigent become architecture critics. In the historic core, weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll explore the tragedy of St. Vincent Court, a thriving open-air restaurant district hobbled by the interests of rival property owners. Then down Broadway and Spring Street, where adaptive reuse and the monthly Art Walk have brought life to spaces which have been dead for decades, even as Broadwayâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s longtime Latino vendors are leaving in droves. The tour concludes in the Arts District, with the bold urban explorers who reclaimed vacant warehouse space at great personal risk, the public policy shift that legalized this creative community, the astonishing growth of the â€œnewâ€ Arts District and what it means for the artists who remain.</p>
<p><strong>WHY â€œTHE LOWDOWN ON DOWNTOWN?â€</strong> â€“ Having studied under architecture critic Reyner Banham in the mid-1980s, tour host Richard Schave has taken it upon himself to correct his teacherâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s gross oversight of downtown Los Angeles, relegated to a dismissive coda in his seminal Los Angeles guidebook<em><a href="https://astore.amazon.com/bubble1-20/detail/0520219244" target="new" rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies</a></em>. Richard and his wife Kim Cooper work extensively with the history and lost cultures of downtown in their bus tours, in their work placing Art Walk into a non-profit, on blogs including <a href="https://onbunkerhill.org/">On Bunker Hill</a>, <a href="https://insroland.org/">In SRO Land</a> and <a href="https://1947project.com/">1947project</a>, and through public lectures on the <a href="https://onbunkerhill.org/lecture">subject</a>. This tour has a significant walking component. It is broken up, but please be advised to be ready to stretch your legs.</p>

<p>The Black Dahlia murder in 1947 is the most compelling unsolved crime Los Angeles has ever known. What Jack the Ripper is to London, the Torso Killer to Cleveland, the Black Dahlia is to L.A. And yet unlike those other cases, the name Black Dahlia refers not to the killer, but to the victim. What was it about Elizabeth Short that keeps her the object of obsessive fascination by writers, musicians, artists, filmmakers, cops and readers, more than sixty years after she was slain?</p>
<p>Esotouric&#8217;s The Real Black Dahlia Crime Tour seeks to answer this question by intimately exploring the last weeks of Elizabeth Shortâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s life, asking not â€œwho killed her?â€ but â€œwho was she?â€</p>
<p>The tour takes us from the human hustle of Main Street to the serene lobby of the Biltmore (the second-to-last place she was seen alive), to the newspaper offices and the Greyhound station where she checked her bags, and concludes at the site where her bisected body was found in Leimert Park and with a little known suspect who lived nearby.</p>
<p>From the few personal possessions she left behind to the friends who scarcely knew her, from the mass hysteria of the investigation with its fruitless leads, wacko suspects and false confessions, the tour reveals all thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s known about this enigmatic black-haired girl who reinvented herself at whim, and shows how she came to be the unfortunate symbol of her time and place.</p>

After many quiet decades, downtown is making an incredible return. But while many of the historic buildings remain, their human context has been lost. This tour aims to revive the ghosts that cling to the bricks and alleyways.</p>
<p>The Hotel Horrors section is a true crime and oddities tour featuring some of the wildest, weirdest, goriest and most memorable happenings in historic hotels like the Alexandria, St. George, Barclay and Cecil. See inside some of these legendary locales and find out where Night Stalker Richard Ramirez dumped his blood-soaked clothing and where Canadian tourist Elisa Lam fell off the map, see the hotel that saw a visit from the Skid Row Slasher and the one where two traveling chocolate salesmen laughed so hard they fell backwards out a window to their deaths. Youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll also explore the fiery curse that repeatedly leveled one building. Included are some light hearted stories to help the blood and gore go down.</p>
<p>The Main Street Vice section celebrates the social history of the ribald, racy, raunchy old promenade where the better people simply did not travel, but kicks were had by all who did. Burlesque babes and dirty picture parlors, mummified western outlaws and old time tattoo parlors, wax museums and pawn brokers, â€œprofessorsâ€ offering sex lectures and magazine peddlers with nudie Marilyn Monroe calendars under the counter, sophisticated steak houses and nickel donut dives â€” these were the pleasures and the people to be found along Main during the first half of the 20th century. Weâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll visit the scenes of some more unforgettable debaucheries and share stories of crime, smut, passion and commerce.</p>
<p>This â€œdowntown double featureâ€ tour is especially recommended for residents curious about their neighborhoodâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s neglected history, and anyone fascinated by grim crimes and gorgeous architecture.</p>

<p>Join us as we go down the mean streets that shaped his fiction, and that in turn shaped his hard-boiled times, in a four hour tour of downtown, Hollywood and surrounding environs: The Los Angeles Athletic Club, the Larry Edmunds Bookshop, the Hotel Van Nuys, Paramount Studioâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s gates, and much, much more, including a Chandler-themed gelato stop at East Hollywood cult favorite Scoops.</p>
<p>Through published work, private correspondence, screenplays and film adaptations, we trace Chandlerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s search for meaning and his anti-hero Philip Marloweâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s struggle to not be pigeonholed or give anything less than all he has, which lead them both down the rabbit hole of isolation, depression, and drink.</p>
<p>Exclusive on this tour: the fascinating story of Raymond Chandler&#8217;s lost comic operetta <a href="https://www.goblinwine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Princess and the Pedlar</a>, a bombshell in Chandler studies, discovered by our own Kim Cooper in 2014.</p>

<p>The Black Dahlia murder in 1947 is the most compelling unsolved crime Los Angeles has ever known. What Jack the Ripper is to London, the Torso Killer to Cleveland, the Black Dahlia is to L.A. And yet unlike those other cases, the name Black Dahlia refers not to the killer, but to the victim. What was it about Elizabeth Short that keeps her the object of obsessive fascination by writers, musicians, artists, filmmakers, cops and readers, more than sixty years after she was slain?</p>
<p>Esotouric&#8217;s The Real Black Dahlia Crime Bus Tour seeks to answer this question by intimately exploring the last weeks of Elizabeth Shortâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s life, asking not â€œwho killed her?â€ but â€œwho was she?â€</p>
<p>The tour takes us from the human hustle of Main Street to the serene lobby of the Biltmore (the second-to-last place she was seen alive), to the newspaper offices and the Greyhound station where she checked her bags, and concludes at the site where her bisected body was found in Leimert Park and with a little known suspect who lived nearby.</p>
<p>From the few personal possessions she left behind to the friends who scarcely knew her, from the mass hysteria of the investigation with its fruitless leads, wacko suspects and false confessions, the tour reveals all thatâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s known about this enigmatic black-haired girl who reinvented herself at whim, and shows how she came to be the unfortunate symbol of her time and place.</p>
