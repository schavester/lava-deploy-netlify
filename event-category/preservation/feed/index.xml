We have been eagerly awaiting this day since the sign was installed in May 2016, as <a href="https://esotouric.com/hotelcalifornian" target="_blank">reported</a> on the Esotouric blog.</p>
<p>Presenters at the event include neon artisan and historian <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-c1-los-angeles-neon-20131203-dto-htmlstory.html" target="_blank">Paul Greenstein</a>, who will discuss his restoration of the sign as well as its complicated journey from the rooftop of the Hotel Californian to its long exile near Griffith Park and back to Westlake.</p>
<p>The Paseo at Californian is a 100% affordable large family property consisting of 53 affordable apartments  (1, 2 and 3 bedrooms) financed with, among other programs, affordable housing tax credits. The building  represents a 7-year long effort of its developers, banks, funding partners and City and State agencies, each  of which are committed to providing Los Angeles with high quality, sustainable, affordable housing.</p>
