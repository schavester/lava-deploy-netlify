<p>Without their passionate advocacy, the derelict adobe Missions would have melted away before the century turned.</p>
<p>Today, Southern Californiaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s landmarks are threatened by corporate developers who seek to extract the maximum value from every inch of land, their demolition and spot-zoning requests enabled by well-greased politicians. Often, the only thing standing in the way of the wrecking ball is a dedicated citizen-activist fighting for a place they love too much to lose without a fight.</p>
<p>They might not realize it, but every local preservationist stands on the shoulders of Lummis.	 </p>
<p>L.A.â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s most eclectic historic tour company Esotouric invites you to gather in the spirit of Charles Fletcher Lummis and in his beloved arroyo home El Alisal, to encourage and learn from preservation activists, mix and mingle with fellow history lovers, enjoy tasty snacks, tour the historic home and gardens and imagine the Los Angeles you want to live in.	 </p>
<p>Our special guest for the August 2019 debut salon is preservation activist Steven Luftman, appearing in conversation with Esotouricâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Richard Schave. Steven will share his personal path to loving and saving old buildings, including his successful landmarking of Kurt Meyerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Lytton Savings (1960), continued threats to the â€œprotectedâ€ building from Frank Gehryâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s mega-project, his efforts to preserve and designate L.A.â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s unique bungalow courts, vernacular apartments and Tom Berginâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Irish pub, and tips for picking the landmarking battles that will feed your soul. A no-holds-barred Q&amp;A follows. Plus, Professor Jeremiah Axelrod, Director for the Institute for the Study of Los Angeles (<span class="caps">ISLA</span>) at Occidental College, with a status report on the proposal to base <span class="caps">ISLA</span> at Lummis House.</p>
<p>Come be part of a supportive and creative preservation community, as we reactivate El Alisal and draw on the homeâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s long tradition of activism, storytelling, social justice and good fellowship. It wouldnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t be the same without <span class="caps">YOU</span>!  </p>

<p>Born in Hollywood, Steven Luftman gained a lifelong appreciation for art and architecture in the mid-century cultural institutions of Los Angeles: at five he opened a savings account at Lytton Savings on the Sunset Strip, he took art classes at the then brand-new William Pereira-designed Los Angeles County Art Museum, took in movies at the Cinerama Dome, and with his mother and sister experienced L.A. Philharmonic rehearsals at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. After graduating from the Craig Ellwood/James Tyler-designed campus of Art Center College of Design, he moved to New York City to work in advertising. </p>
<p>Returning to Los Angeles in 1997, Steven used the seminal Gebhard &amp; Winter â€œAn Architectural Guidebook to Los Angelesâ€ in his search for the perfect apartment. With some luck, Steven and his partner Karen found themselves in what would become the Mendel and Mabel Meyer Courtyard Apartments (Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #1096). While always a preservationist and a social activist at heart, it wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t until his beloved home of eighteen years was threatened with demolition in 2015 that he wrote his first Historic-Cultural Monument application. </p>
<p>To date, Steven has written or co-written ten <span class="caps">HCM</span> applications, and has been an active participant in trying to save fifteen historically-significant buildings. He also campaigns for affordable housing and is active in the tenantsâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> rights movement, and can regularly be found in City Hall supporting the preservation efforts of others. Steven longs for the day when greedy developers take a break from trying to destroy the historic buildings and neighborhoods of Los Angeles so he can take enough time off to enjoy his other passion, racing his 1978 CrosslÃ© Formula Ford.</p>

<p>Such is the perceived wisdom about the Los Angeles Mall, an underappreciated and underutilized shopping, dining and public plaza development which is in the cross-hairs of the same City Council-driven redevelopment plan that calls for the demolition of Welton Becketâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Parker Center. </p>
<p>Join us for an afternoon exploring the history, integrated artwork and possibilities of a cultural landscape that is worth reconsidering â€“ before itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s too late! This Sunday Salon and walking tour will be hosted by Richard Schave &amp; Nathan Marsak with contributions from Joseph Youngâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s daughters, Cecily &amp; Leslie Young.</p>
<p>The entire Los Angeles Civic Center, which includes the Los Angeles Mall, is being re-imagined, and the Civic Center Master Plan (<a href="https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2014/14-1604_misc_1_12-07-2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF link</a>) has just been approved. The Master Plan calls for the the Department of Cultural Affairs to produce a report on the public art in the Los Angeles Mall (The Public Art District Plan) which is sensitive to its history and comprehensive in scope.  We believe this document should set a new bar for how DCA is to take the lead on advocating for and preserving public art throughout Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The goal of this Sunday Salon is identify and to advocate for the public art and landscape of the Los Angeles Mall, and for <a href="https://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/26/local/me-young26" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph Young</a>â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s â€œTheme Mural of Los Angelesâ€ (1955), slated for removal, restoration and relocation, in the adjacent, soon-to-be-demolished <a href="https://esotouric.com/saveparkercenter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parker Center</a>. </p>
<p>The Los Angeles Mall was constructed between 1973 and 1975 and occupies 1.5 square blocks on the east side of City Hall, from Main to Los Angeles Street, running north to Aliso. Stanton &amp; Stockwell were the architects, and the landscape architects were <a href="https://tclf.org/pioneer/cornell-bridgers-and-troller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cornell, Bridgers, Troller and Hazlett</a>. The two plazas which make up the mall are surrounded by civic buildings. At Temple Street, a stunning 120â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> cantilevered <a href="https://www.publicartinla.com/CivicCenter/bridge.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pedestrian bridge</a> by the Mallâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s landscape architect Howard Troller and artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Van_Sant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Van Sant</a> connects the plazas.</p>
<p>The South Plaza, dominated by the Brutalist City Hall East, includes the <a href="https://www.publicartinla.com/CivicCenter/chambers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eleanor Chambers Memorial Fountain</a> (also known as Dan-de-lion for its effect when running) designed by <a href="https://www.publicartinla.com/CivicCenter/troller_bio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard Troller</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanns_Scharff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hanns Scharff</a>. A sunken palm court features Jan Peter Sternâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s stainless steel <a href="https://www.publicartinla.com/CivicCenter/stern.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cubed Square</a> and arcing paths which lead off to retail and food court options in the subterranean North and South Malls. There are four levels of below-ground parking.</p>
<p>The North Plaza, called Fletcher Bowron Square after the reformer mayor (served 1938-53), is defined by Joseph Youngâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s neglected 60-foot-tall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triforium_(Los_Angeles){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}">Triforium</a> (1975) a free-standing computerized sound and light sculpture comprised of 1,500 blown-glass prisms synchronized to an electronic glass bell carillon. The adjacent sunken plaza has a food court, a collection of mature palms, and the <a href="https://www.publicartinla.com/CivicCenter/stevenson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert J. Stevenson Fountain</a>, which consists of a carved and painted obelisk set in a tiled pool of centrifugal jets.</p>
<p>Doug Dunn is a specialist in legacy, enterprise, and proprietary computers. In practice, this really just means anything that is not a server, desktop, laptop, or phone &#8211; in other words, &#8220;weird computers&#8221;. Starting as an e-waste reseller in college, he turned a fascination with computing history into a career path. After an unsatisfying stint with a tech &#8220;start up&#8221;, he decided to start his own business focusing on support for the IBM AS/400 and z/System product lines. Legacy computing consultation is a very niche field, so he hopes to get some high-profile exposure from his first major project, the Triforium restoration. During the initial review, he found the original paper software tapes, and believe that the system can be made to appear functionally identical to its intended design.</p>

<p>Starting in the basement of Grand Central Market, Suzanne will describe the defining characteristics of this poetry, whose dark themes, atmosphere, and voice of cool detachment are inspired by the low budget black-and-white crime movies of the 1940s and 1950s.

<p>ABOUT THE SALON: On the last Sunday of the month starting at 2pm, LAVA welcomes interested individuals to gather in downtown Los Angeles for the Sunday Salon, featuring a presentation by a LAVA Visionary and opportunities to meet and connect with one another. Immediately after the Salon, a walking tour expands on the Salon theme. If youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re interested in joining LAVA as a creative contributor or an attendee, we recommend Salon attendance as an introduction to this growing community.</p>
